-it aome510/spotify_player:latest

```

## Features
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#features)
### Spotify Connect
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#spotify-connect)
To enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, user will need to register a Spotify application and specify the application's `client_id` in the general configuration file as described in the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#general).
More details about registering a Spotify application can be found in the [official Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).
When `spotify_player` runs with your own `client_id`, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.
### Streaming
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#streaming)
`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.
The application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#spotify-connect) device list.
#### Audio backend
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#audio-backend)
`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:
  * `alsa-backend`
  * `pulseaudio-backend`
  * `rodio-backend`
  * `portaudio-backend`
  * `jackaudio-backend`
  * `rodiojack-backend`
  * `sdl-backend`
  * `gstreamer-backend`


User can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run
```
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend
```

**Note** :
  * needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.
  * user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).


The `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running
```
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features
```

### Media Control
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#media-control)
To enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#media-control).
Media control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.
### Image
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#image)
To enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:
```
cargo install spotify_player --features image
```

`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).
`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:
```
cargo install spotify_player --features sixel
```

**Notes** :
  * Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).
  * Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It's recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.


Examples of image rendering:
  * iTerm2:

[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#notify)
To enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:
```
cargo install spotify_player --features notify
```

**Note** : the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.
### Mouse support
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#mouse-support)
Currently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback's progress bar.
### Daemon
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#daemon)
To enable a [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_\(computing\)) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:
```
cargo install spotify_player --features daemon
```

You can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.
**Notes** :
  * `daemon` feature is not supported on Windows
  * `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#audio-backend)
  * because of the OS's restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn't work with the `media-control` feature on MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled** :
```
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend
```



### Fuzzy search
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#fuzzy-search)
To enable [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `fzf` feature (**disabled** by default).
### CLI Commands
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#cli-commands)
`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with Spotify:
  * `get`: Get Spotify data (playlist/album/artist data, user's data, etc)
  * `playback`: Interact with the playback (start a playback, play-pause, next, etc)
  * `search`: Search spotify
  * `connect`: Connect to a Spotify device
  * `like`: Like currently playing track
  * `authenticate`: Authenticate the application
  * `playlist`: Playlist editing (new, delete, import, fork, etc)


For more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.
**Notes**
  * When using the CLI for the first time, you'll need to run `spotify_player authenticate` to authenticate the application beforehand.
  * Under the hood, CLI command is handled by sending requests to a `spotify_player` client socket running on port `client_port`, [a general application configuration](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#general) with a default value of `8080`. If there is no running application's instance, a new client will be created upon handling the CLI commands, which increases the latency of the command.


#### Scripting
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#scripting)
The `spotify_player` command-line interface makes scripting easy. With the `search` subcommand, you can search Spotify and retrieve data in JSON format, enabling queries with tools like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).
Here’s an example of starting playback for the first track from a search query:
```
read -p "Search spotify: " query
spotify_player playback start track --id $(spotify_player search "$query" | jq '.tracks.[0].id' | xargs)
```

## Commands
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#commands)
To go to the shortcut help page, press `?` or `C-h` (default shortcuts for `OpenCommandHelp` command).
**Tips** :
  * you can search in the shortcut help page (and some other pages) using `Search` command
  * `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.
  * `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.

### Actions
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#actions)
A general list of actions is available; however, not all Spotify items (track, album, artist, or playlist) implement each action. To get the list of available actions on an item, call the `ShowActionsOnCurrentTrack` command or the `ShowActionsOnSelectedItem` command, then press enter (default binding for the `ChooseSelected` command) to initiate the selected action. Some actions may not appear in the popup but can be bound to a shortcut.
List of available actions:
  * `GoToArtist`
  * `GoToAlbum`
  * `GoToRadio`
  * `AddToLibrary`
  * `AddToPlaylist`
  * `AddToQueue`
  * `AddToLiked`
  * `DeleteFromLiked`
  * `DeleteFromLibrary`
  * `DeleteFromPlaylist`
  * `ShowActionsOnAlbum`
  * `ShowActionsOnArtist`
  * `ShowActionsOnShow`
  * `ToggleLiked`
  * `CopyLink`
  * `Follow`
  * `Unfollow`


These actions can also be bound to a shortcut. To add new shortcuts, please refer to the [actions section](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#actions) in the configuration documentation.
### Search Page
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#search-page)
When first entering the search page, the application focuses on the search input. User can then input text, delete one character backward using `backspace`, or search the text using `enter`.
To move the focus from the search input to the other windows such as track results, album results, etc, use `FocusNextWindow` or `FocusPreviousWindow`.
## Configurations
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#configurations)
By default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.config/spotify-player` for application's configuration files. This can be changed by either specifying `-c <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--config-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.
If an application configuration file is not found, one will be created with default values.
Please refer to [the configuration documentation](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md) for more details on the configuration options.
## Caches
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#caches)
By default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.cache/spotify-player` for application's cache files, which include log files, Spotify's authorization credentials, audio cache files, etc. This can be changed by either specifying `-C <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--cache-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.
### Logging
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#logging)
The application stores logs inside the `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.log` file. For debugging or submitting an issue, user can also refer to the backtrace file in `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.backtrace`, which includes the application's backtrace in case of panics/unexpected errors.
`spotify_player` uses `RUST_LOG` environment variable to define the application's [logging level](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.14/log/enum.Level.html). `RUST_LOG` is default to be `spotify_player=INFO`, which only shows the application's logs.
## Acknowledgement
[](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player#acknowledgement)
`spotify_player` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and is built on top of awesome libraries such as [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify), [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), and [many more](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/spotify_player/Cargo.toml). It's highly inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) and [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot).
