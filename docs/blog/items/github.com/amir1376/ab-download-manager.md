## Build From Source
[](https://github.com/amir1376/ab-download-manager#build-from-source)
to compile and test desktop app on your local machine follow these steps.
  1. Clone the project
  2. Install the [JBR](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases)
    1. If you extract it to your home directory and don't want to modify global `JAVA_HOME` environment variable you can set `JAVA_HOME` to the extracted directory e.g. `export JAVA_HOME=~/jbrsdk_jcef-21.0.4-linux-x64-b620.4` for linux or `$env:JAVA_HOME="C:\path\to\jbr"` on Windows
  3. cd into the project, open your terminal and execute the following commands
  4. select which way you want to compile the app

Packaged (msi,deb at the moment)
```
./gradlew
./gradlew packageReleaseDistributionForCurrentOS
```

This will create an installer package for your **current OS** , so you can install it on your own
> Note: you will get error if your OS does not support any of above package types in this case you should compile it `without packaging`
Without Package
In case you don't want to package it or your OS does not support those package types you can use this command to compile the app without packaging it
```
./gradlew
./gradlew createReleaseDistributable
```

It will create an output folder
> NOTE: this is not packaged you may package it yourself manually, or just simply run it!
> I suggest you to move the output somewhere else if you want to run it directly
The output will be created in
```
<project_dir>/desktop/app/build/compose/binaries/main-release/

```
