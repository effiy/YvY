[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6196971/198704107-6775a0ba-669d-418b-9ae9-59228aaa84d1.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6196971/198704107-6775a0ba-669d-418b-9ae9-59228aaa84d1.gif)
## üìÉ Docs
[](https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash#-docs)
See the docs site at [dlvhdr.github.io/gh-dash](https://dlvhdr.github.io/gh-dash) to get started.
## ‚ùì Why use gh-dash
[](https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash#-why-use-gh-dash)
Check out this 10/10 video by [charm.sh ‚ú®](https://charm.sh) explaining how gh-dash can help you manage your GitHub experience.
[![Manage open source like a boss \(in the terminal\)](https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash/raw/main/docs/assets/charm-vid-preview.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omFxcNjBQk&t "Manage open source like a boss \(in the terminal\)")
## ‚ú® Features
[](https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash#-features)
  * üåÖ fully configurable - define sections using GitHub filters
  * üîç search for both prs and issues
  * üìù customize columns with `hidden`, `width` and `grow` props
  * ‚ö°Ô∏è act on prs and issues with checkout, comment, open, merge, diff, etc...
  * ‚å®Ô∏è set custom actions with new keybindings
  * üíÖ use custom themes
  * üî≠ view details about a pr/issue with a detailed sidebar
  * ü™ü write multiple configuration files to easily switch between completely different dashboards
  * ‚ôªÔ∏è set an interval for auto refreshing the dashboard
  * üìÅ smart filtering - auto-filter pr/issue lists to the remote tracked by the current directory


## üì¶ Installation
[](https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash#-installation)
  1. Install the `gh` CLI - see the [installation](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
_Installation requires a minimum version (2.0.0) of the GitHub CLI that supports extensions._
  2. Install this extension:
```
gh extension install dlvhdr/gh-dash
```

  3. To get the icons to render properly you should download and install a Nerd font from <https://www.nerdfonts.com/>. Then, select that font as your font for the terminal.

Installing Manually
> If you want to install this extension **manually** , follow these steps:
  1. Clone the repo
```
# git
git clone https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash
```

```
# GitHub CLI
gh repo clone dlvhdr/gh-dash
```

  2. Cd into it
```
cd gh-dash
```

  3. Build it
```
go build
```

  4. Install it locally
```
gh extension install .
```


Updating from an older version
```
gh extension upgrade dlvhdr/gh-dash
```

How do I get these exact colors and font?
> I'm using [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) with the [tokyonight theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) and the [Fira Code](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) Nerd Font. For my full setup check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/dlvhdr/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml).
## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
[](https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash#Ô∏è-usage)
Run
```
gh dash
```

Then press `?` for help.
Run `gh dash --help` for more info:
```
Usage:
 gh dash [flags]
Flags:
 -c, --config string  use this configuration file
            (default lookup:
             1. a .gh-dash.yml file if inside a git repo
             2. $GH_DASH_CONFIG env var
             3. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh-dash/config.yml
            )
   --debug      passing this flag will allow writing debug output to debug.log
 -h, --help      help for gh-dash

```
