[中文用户？点我查看中文介绍](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy/blob/dev/README_zh.md)
QtScrcpy supports displaying and controlling Android devices via USB or over network. It does NOT require root privileges.
It supports three major platforms: GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS.
It focuses on:
  * **lightness** (displays only the device screen)
  * **performance** (30~60 fps)
  * **quality** (1920×1080 or above)
  * **low latency** ([35~70ms](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/646))
  * **low startup time** (only about 1 second to display the first frame)
  * **non-intrusiveness** (nothing will be installed on the device)

## Mapping Keys
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#mapping-keys)
You can write your script to map keyboard and mouse actions to touches and clicks of the mobile phone according to your needs. [Here](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy/blob/dev/docs/KeyMapDes.md) are the script writing rules.
Script for TikTok and some other games are provided by default. Once enabled, you can play the game with your keyboard and mouse. The default key mapping for PUBG Mobile is as follows:
[![game](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy/raw/dev/screenshot/game.png)](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy/blob/dev/screenshot/game.png)
Instruction for adding new customized mapping files.
  * Write a customized script and put it in the `keymap` directory
  * Click `refresh script` to show it
  * Select your script
  * Connect to your phone, start service and click `apply`
  * Press `~` key (the SwitchKey in the key map script) to switch to custom mapping mode
  * Press the ~ key again to switch back to normal mode
  * (For games such as PUBG Mobile) If you want to move vehicles with the STEER_WHEEL keys, you need to set the move mode to `single rocker mode`.


If you don't know how to manually write mapping rules, you can also use the `QuickAssistant` developed by the author QuickAssistant Features&Functions:
  * Play Android mobile games smoothly through keyboard and mouse
  * Interface based editing of key mapping script
  * Support pausing the computer screen and using only keyboard and mouse operations
  * Screenshot&Recording of Mobile Screen
  * Simple batch control
  * Android 11+supports playing mobile audio on computers (under development...)
  * Mobile app installation free
  * Fast and instant connection
  * Low latency: USB screen mirroring 1080p latency is within 30ms, which is lower than all screen mirroring software on the market in terms of latency at the same resolution and smoothness
  * Low CPU usage: pure C++development, high-performance GPU video rendering
  * High resolution: adjustable, maximum support for native resolution of Android terminals

## Thanks
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#thanks)
QtScrcpy is based on [Genymobile](https://github.com/Genymobile)'s [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) project. Thanks a lot!
The difference between QtScrcpy and the original scrcpy is as follows:
key points | scrcpy | QtScrcpy  
---|---|---  
ui | sdl | qt  
video encode | ffmpeg | ffmpeg  
video render | sdl | opengl  
cross-platform | self implemented | provided by Qt  
language | C | C++  
style | sync | async  
keymap | no custom keymap | support custom keymap  
build | meson+gradle | qmake or CMake  
  * It's very easy to customize your GUI with Qt
  * Asynchronous programming of Qt-based signal slot mechanism improves performance
  * Easy to learn
  * Add support for multi-touch

## Why develop QtScrcpy?
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#why-develop-qtscrcpy)
There are several reasons listed below according to importance (high to low).
  1. In the process of learning Qt, I need a real project to try.
  2. I have some background skills in audio and video and I am interested in them.
  3. I have some Android development skills. But I have used it for a long time. I want to consolidate it.
  4. I found scrcpy and decided to re-make it with the new technology stack (C++ + Qt + Opengl + FFmpeg).


## Build
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#build)
All the dependencies are provided and it is easy to compile.
### QtScrcpy
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#qtscrcpy-1)
#### Non-Arch Linux Users
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#non-arch-linux-users)
  1. Set up the Qt development environment with the official Qt installer or third-party tools such as [aqt](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall) on the target platform. Qt version bigger than 5.12 is required. (use MSVC 2019 on Windows)
  2. Clone the project with `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:barry-ran/QtScrcpy.git`
  3. For Windows, open CMakeLists.txt with QtCreator and compile Release
  4. For Linux, directly run `./ci/linux/build_for_linux.sh "Release"` Note: compiled artifacts are located at `output/x64/Release`


#### Arch Linux Users
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#arch-linux-users)
  1. Install packages: `base-devel cmake qt5-base qt5-multimedia qt5-x11extras` (`qtcreator` is recommended)
  2. Clone the project with `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:barry-ran/QtScrcpy.git`
  3. Run `./ci/linux/build_for_linux.sh "Release"`


### Scrcpy-Server
[](https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy#scrcpy-server)
  1. Set up Android development environment on the target platform
  2. Open server project in project root with Android Studio
  3. The first time you open it, if you do not have the corresponding version of Gradle, you will be prompted to find Gradle, whether to upgrade Gradle or create it. Select Cancel. After cancelling, you will be prompted to select the location of existing Gradle. Cancel it too and it will download automatically.
  4. After compiling the apk, rename it to scrcpy-server and replace QtScrcpy/QtScrcpyCore/src/third_party/scrcpy-server.
