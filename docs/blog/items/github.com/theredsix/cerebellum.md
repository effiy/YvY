# Cerebellum
[](https://github.com/theredsix/cerebellum#cerebellum)
A lightweight browser using agent that accomplishes user-defined goals on webpages using keyboard and mouse actions.
## See It In Action
[](https://github.com/theredsix/cerebellum#see-it-in-action)
Goal: `Find a USB C to C cable that is 10 feet long and add it to cart`
amazon.mp4
## Setup
[](https://github.com/theredsix/cerebellum#setup)
Please see setup directions for your language:
  * [Python](https://github.com/theredsix/cerebellum/blob/main/python/README.md#setup)
  * [Typescript](https://github.com/theredsix/cerebellum/blob/main/typescript/README.md#setup)


## How It Works
[](https://github.com/theredsix/cerebellum#how-it-works)
  1. Web browsing is simplified to navigating a directed graph.
  2. Each webpage is a node with visible elements and data.
  3. User actions, such as clicking or typing, are edges that move between nodes.
  4. Cerebellum starts at a webpage and aims to reach a target node that embodies the completed goal.
  5. It uses a LLM to finds new nodes by analyzing page content and interactive elements.
  6. The LLM decides the next action based on the current state and past actions.
  7. Cerebellum executes the LLM's planned action and feeds the new state back into the LLM for next step.
  8. The process ends when the LLM decides the goal has been reached or is unachieveable.


_Currently, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the only supported LLM_
## Features
