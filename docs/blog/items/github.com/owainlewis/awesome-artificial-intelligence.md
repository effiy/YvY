## Philosophy
[](https://github.com/owainlewis/awesome-artificial-intelligence#philosophy)
  * [Super Intelligence](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/Superintelligence-Audiobook/B00LPMA33G) - Superintelligence asks the question: What happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence?
  * [Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence And The End Of The Human Era](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/Our-Final-Invention-Audiobook/B00KLJMDH8) - Our Final Invention explores the perils of the heedless pursuit of advanced AI. Until now, human intelligence has had no rival. Can we coexist with beings whose intelligence dwarfs our own? And will they allow us to?
  * [How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed](http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/How-to-Create-a-Mind-Audiobook/B009S7OKJS/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1422483493&sr=1-1) - Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, explored the process of reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, then applies that knowledge to create vastly intelligent machines.
  * [Minds, Brains, And Programs](http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf) - The 1980 paper by philosopher John Searle that contains the famous 'Chinese Room' thought experiment. It is probably the most famous attack on the notion of a Strong AI possessing a 'mind' or a 'consciousness', and it is an interesting reading for those interested in the intersection of AI and philosophy of mind.
  * [Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567) - Written by Douglas Hofstadter and taglined "a metaphorical fugue on minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll", this incredible journey into the fundamental concepts of mathematics, symmetry and intelligence won a Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction in 1979. A major theme throughout is the emergence of meaning from seemingly 'meaningless' elements, like 1's and 0's, arranged in special patterns.
  * [Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34272565-life-3-0) - Max Tegmark, professor of Physics at MIT, discusses how Artificial Intelligence may affect crime, war, justice, jobs, society and our very sense of being human both in the near and far future.
