Motrix is a full-featured download manager that supports downloading HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet, etc.
Motrix has a clean and easy to use interface. I hope you will like it 👻.
✈️ [Official Website](https://motrix.app) | 📖 [Manual](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/wiki)
## 💽 Installation
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#-installation)
Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/releases) and install it.
### Windows
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#windows)
It is recommended to install Motrix using the installation package (Motrix-Setup-x.y.z.exe) to ensure a complete experience, such as associating torrent files, capturing magnet links, etc.
If you use package management tools to manage applications on Windows, such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop). You can use them to install Motrix.
#### Chocolatey
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#chocolatey)
Thanks to [@Yato](https://github.com/iYato) for continuing to maintain the [Motrix Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/motrix) package. To install motrix, run the following command from the `command line` or from `PowerShell`:
```
# Install
choco install motrix
# Upgrade
choco upgrade motrix
```

#### scoop
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#scoop)
If you prefer the portable version, you can use [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) (need Windows 7+) to install Motrix.
```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install motrix
```

### macOS
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#macos)
The macOS users can install Motrix using `brew`, thanks to [PR](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/59494) of [@Mitscherlich](https://github.com/Mitscherlich).
```
brew update && brew install motrix
```

#### Auto Update
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#auto-update)
Since Motrix v1.8.0 and later versions changed the App BundleID ( `net.agalwood.Motrix` => `app.motrix.native` ), the automatic update of Motrix v1.6.11 will fail. [Motrix Install Assistant](https://github.com/motrixapp/motrix-install-assistant) will help you install the latest Motrix application.
[ ![Motrix Install Assistant Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motrixapp/motrix-install-assistant/main/build/256x256.png) ](https://github.com/motrixapp/motrix-install-assistant)
### Linux
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#linux)
You can download the `AppImage` (for all Linux distributions) or `snap` to install Motrix, see [GitHub/release](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/releases) for more Linux installation package formats.
Motrix may need to run with `sudo` for the first time in Linux because there is no permission to create the download session file (`/var/cache/aria2.session`).
If you want to build from source code, please read the **Build** section.
#### AppImage
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#appimage)
The latest version of Motrix AppImage requires you to manually perform desktop integration. Please check the documentation of [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) .
> Desktop Integration Since electron-builder 21 desktop integration is not a part of produced AppImage file. [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) is the recommended way to integrate AppImages.
Deepin 20 Beta users failed to install Motrix, please follow the steps below:
Open the `Terminal`, paste and run the following command to install Motrix again.
```
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

#### Snap
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#snap)
Motrix has been listed on [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/motrix) , Ubuntu users recommend downloading from the Snap Store.
Tips for v1.5.10
The tray may not display the indicator normally, which makes it inconvenient to exit the application.
Please unchecked Preferences--Basic Settings--Hide App Menu (Windows & Linux Only), click Save & Apply. Then click "Exit" in the File menu to exit the application.
Please update to v1.5.12 and above, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `q` to quickly exit the application.
#### AUR
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#aur)
For Arch Linux users, Motrix is available in [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/motrix/), thanks to the maintainer [@weearc](https://github.com/weearc).
Run the following command to install:
```
yay -S motrix
```

#### Flatpak
[](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix#flatpak)
Thanks to the [PR](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/2334) of [@proletarius101](https://github.com/proletarius101), Motrix has been listed [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.agalwood.Motrix), Linux users who like the Flatpak can try it.
```
