## About
[](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#about)
LocalSend is a cross-platform app that enables secure communication between devices using a REST API and HTTPS encryption. Unlike other messaging apps that rely on external servers, LocalSend doesn't require an internet connection or third-party servers, making it a fast and reliable solution for local communication.

It is recommended to download the app either from an app store or from a package manager because the app does not have an auto-update.

**Compatibility**
Platform | Minimum Version | Note  
---|---|---  
Android | 5.0 | -  
iOS | 12.0 | -  
macOS | 11 Big Sur | Use OpenCore Legacy Patcher 2.0.2 (See [#1005](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/issues/1005#issuecomment-2449899384))  
Windows | 10 | The last version to support Windows 7 is v1.15.4. There might be backports of newer versions for Windows 7 in the future.  
Linux | N.A. | -  
## Setup
[](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#setup)
In most cases, LocalSend should work out of the box. However, if you are having trouble sending or receiving files, you may need to configure your firewall to allow LocalSend to communicate over your local network.
Traffic Type | Protocol | Port | Action  
---|---|---|---  
Incoming | TCP, UDP | 53317 | Allow  
Outgoing | TCP, UDP | Any | Allow  
Also make sure to disable AP isolation on your router. It should be usually disabled by default but some routers may have it enabled (especially guest networks). See [troubleshooting](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#troubleshooting) for more information.
**Portable Mode**
(Introduced in v1.13.0)
Create a file named `settings.json` located in the same directory as the executable. This file can be empty. The app will use this file to store settings instead of the default location.
**Start hidden**
(Updated in v1.15.0)
To start the app hidden (only in tray), use the `--hidden` flag (example: `localsend_app.exe --hidden`).
On v1.14.0 and earlier, the app starts hidden if `autostart` flag is set, and the hidden setting is enabled.
## How It Works
[](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#how-it-works)
LocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.
For more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the [documentation](https://github.com/localsend/protocol).
## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#getting-started)
To compile LocalSend from the source code, follow these steps:
  1. Install Flutter [directly](https://flutter.dev) or using [fvm](https://fvm.app) (see [version required](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/main/.fvmrc))
  2. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  3. Clone the `LocalSend` repository
  4. Run `cd app` to enter the app directory
  5. Run `flutter pub get` to download dependencies
  6. Run `flutter run` to start the app


Note
LocalSend currently requires an older Flutter version (specified in [.fvmrc](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/main/.fvmrc)) and thus build issues may be caused by a mismatch between the required and the (system-wide) installed Flutter version. To make development more consistent, LocalSend uses [fvm](https://fvm.app) to manage the project Flutter version. After installing `fvm`, run `fvm flutter` instead of `flutter`.
## Contributing
[](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#contributing)
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping improve LocalSend. If you'd like to contribute, there are a few ways to get involved:
### Translation
[](https://github.com/localsend/localsend#translation)
You can help translate LocalSend into other languages. We use the [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/localsend/app) platform to manage translations.
Alternatively, you can also contribute by forking this repository and adding translations manually.
The translations are located in the [app/assets/i18n](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/tree/main/app/assets/i18n) directory. Edit the `_missing_translations_<locale>.json` or `strings_<locale>.i18n.json` file to add or update translations.
