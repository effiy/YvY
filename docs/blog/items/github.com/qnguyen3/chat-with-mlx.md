## Features
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#features)
  * **Privacy-enhanced AI** : Chat with your favourite models and data securely.
  * **MLX Playground** : Your all in one LLM Chat UI for Apple MLX
  * **Easy Integration** : Easy integrate any HuggingFace and MLX Compatible Open-Source Models.
  * **Default Models** : Llama-3, Phi-3, Yi, Qwen, Mistral, Codestral, Mixtral, StableLM (along with Dolphin and Hermes variants)


## Installation and Usage
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#installation-and-usage)
### Easy Setup
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#easy-setup)
  * Install Pip
  * Install: `pip install chat-with-mlx`


### Manual Pip Installation
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#manual-pip-installation)
```
git clone https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx.git
cd chat-with-mlx
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

#### Manual Conda Installation
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#manual-conda-installation)
```
git clone https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx.git
cd chat-with-mlx
conda create -n mlx-chat python=3.11
conda activate mlx-chat
pip install -e .
```

#### Usage
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#usage)
  * Start the app: `chat-with-mlx`


## Add Your Model
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#add-your-model)
Please checkout the guide [HERE](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx/blob/main/ADD_MODEL.MD)
## Known Issues
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#known-issues)
  * When the model is downloading by Solution 1, the only way to stop it is to hit `control + C` on your Terminal.
  * If you want to switch the file, you have to manually hit STOP INDEXING. Otherwise, the vector database would add the second document to the current database.
  * You have to choose a dataset mode (Document or YouTube) in order for it to work.
  * **Phi-3-small** can't do streaming in completions


## Why MLX?
[](https://github.com/qnguyen3/chat-with-mlx#why-mlx)
MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple silicon, brought to you by Apple machine learning research.
Some key features of MLX include:
  * **Familiar APIs** : MLX has a Python API that closely follows NumPy. MLX also has fully featured C++, [C](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c), and [Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift/) APIs, which closely mirror the Python API. MLX has higher-level packages like `mlx.nn` and `mlx.optimizers` with APIs that closely follow PyTorch to simplify building more complex models.
  * **Composable function transformations** : MLX supports composable function transformations for automatic differentiation, automatic vectorization, and computation graph optimization.
  * **Lazy computation** : Computations in MLX are lazy. Arrays are only materialized when needed.
  * **Dynamic graph construction** : Computation graphs in MLX are constructed dynamically. Changing the shapes of function arguments does not trigger slow compilations, and debugging is simple and intuitive.
  * **Multi-device** : Operations can run on any of the supported devices (currently the CPU and the GPU).
  * **Unified memory** : A notable difference from MLX and other frameworks is the _unified memory model_. Arrays in MLX live in shared memory. Operations on MLX arrays can be performed on any of the supported device types without transferring data.


## Acknowledgement
