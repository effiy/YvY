# Welcome to the Gemini API Cookbook
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#welcome-to-the-gemini-api-cookbook)
This cookbook provides a structured learning path for using the Gemini API, focusing on hands-on tutorials and practical examples.
**For comprehensive API documentation, visit[ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs).**
## Important: Migration
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#important-migration)
With Gemini 2 we are offering a [new SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai) (`google-genai[](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/)`, `v1.0`). The updated SDK is fully compatible with all Gemini API models and features, including recent additions like the [live API](https://aistudio.google.com/live) (audio + video streaming), improved tool usage ( [code execution](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution?lang=python), [function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling/tutorial?lang=python) and integrated [Google search grounding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding?lang=python)), and media generation ([Imagen](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen)). This SDK allows you to connect to the Gemini API through either [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash-exp) or [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/gemini-v2).
The `google-generativeai[](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai)` package will continue to support the original Gemini models. It _can_ also be used with Gemini 2 models, just with a limited feature set. All new features will be developed in the new Google GenAI SDK.
See the [migration guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate) for details. 
## Navigating the Cookbook
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#navigating-the-cookbook)
This cookbook is organized into two main categories:
  1. **[Quick Starts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/):** Step-by-step guides covering both introductory topics ("[Get Started](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started.ipynb)") and specific API features.
  2. **[Examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/examples/):** Practical use cases demonstrating how to combine multiple features.


We also showcase **Demos** in separate repositories, illustrating end-to-end applications of the Gemini API. 
## What's New?
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#whats-new)
Here are the recent additions and updates to the Gemini API and the Cookbook:
  * **Gemini 2.0 models:** Explore the capabilities of the latest Gemini 2.0 models! See the [Get Started Guide](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started.ipynb).
  * **Imagen** : Get started with our image generation model with this brand new [Imagen guide](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_imagen.ipynb)!
  * **Recently Added Guides:**
    * [Browser as a tool](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Browser_as_a_tool.ipynb): Use a web browser for live and internal (intranet) web interactions
    * [Code execution](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Code_Execution.ipynb): Generating and running Python code to solve complex tasks and even output graphs
    * [Thinking model](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_thinking.ipynb): Discover the thinking model capabilities.


## 1. Quick Starts
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#1-quick-starts)
The [quickstarts section](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/) contains step-by-step tutorials to get you started with Gemini and learn about its specific features.
**To begin, you'll need:**
  1. A Google account.
  2. An API key (create one in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)). 


We recommend starting with the following:
  * [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb): Set up your API key for access.
  * [**Get started**](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started.ipynb): Get started with Gemini models and the Gemini API, covering basic prompting and multimodal input. 


Then, explore the other quickstarts tutorials to learn about individual features:
  * [Get started with Live API](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_LiveAPI.ipynb): Get started with the live API with this comprehensive overview of its capabilities
  * [Get started with Imagen](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_imagen.ipynb) and [Image-out](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Image_out.ipynb): Get started with our image generation capabilities
  * [Grounding](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Search_Grounding.ipynb): use Google Search for grounded responses
  * [Code execution](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Code_Execution.ipynb): Generating and running Python code to solve complex tasks and even ouput graphs
  * And [many more](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/)


## 2. Examples (Practical Use Cases)
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#2-examples-practical-use-cases)
These examples demonstrate how to combine multiple Gemini API features or 3rd-party tools to build more complex applications.
  * [Illustrate a book](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Book_illustration.ipynb): Use Gemini and Imagen to create illustration for an open-source book
  * [Animated Story Generation](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Animated_Story_Video_Generation_gemini.ipynb): Create animated videos by combining Gemini's story generation, Imagen, and audio synthesis
  * [Plotting and mapping Live](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/LiveAPI_plotting_and_mapping.ipynb): Mix _Live API_ and _Code execution_ to solve complex tasks live

  * [Multimodal Live API Web Console](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console): React-based starter app for using the Multimodal Live API over a websocket
  * [Google AI Studio Starter Applets](https://github.com/google-gemini/starter-applets): A collection of small apps that demonstrate how Gemini can be used to create interactive experiences 


## Official SDKs
[](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook#official-sdks)
The Gemini API is a REST API. You can call it directly using tools like `curl` (see [REST examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/rest/) or the great [Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/ai-on-postman/google-gemini-apis/overview)), or use one of our official SDKs:
  * [Python](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai)
  * [Go](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-go)
  * [Node.js](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-js)
