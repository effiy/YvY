# Paperless-ngx
[](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#paperless-ngx)
Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, _less paper_.
Paperless-ngx is the official successor to the original [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) & [Paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) projects and is designed to distribute the responsibility of advancing and supporting the project among a team of people. [Consider joining us!](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#community-support)
Thanks to the generous folks at [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/8d70b916d462), a demo is available at [demo.paperless-ngx.com](https://demo.paperless-ngx.com) using login `demo` / `demo`. _Note: demo content is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded._

# Features
[](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#features)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/docs/assets/screenshots/documents-smallcards.png)
A full list of [features](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/#features) and [screenshots](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/#screenshots) are available in the [documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/).
# Getting started
[](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#getting-started)
The easiest way to deploy paperless is `docker compose`. The files in the [`/docker/compose` directory](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/tree/main/docker/compose) are configured to pull the image from the GitHub container registry.
If you'd like to jump right in, you can configure a `docker compose` environment with our install script:
```
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"
```

More details and step-by-step guides for alternative installation methods can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#installation).
Migrating from Paperless-ng is easy, just drop in the new docker image! See the [documentation on migrating](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#migrating-to-paperless-ngx) for more details.

# Important Note
[](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#important-note)
> Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. **Paperless-ngx should never be run on an untrusted host** because information is stored in clear text without encryption. No guarantees are made regarding security (but we do try!) and you use the app at your own risk. **The safest way to run Paperless-ngx is on a local server in your own home with backups in place**.
