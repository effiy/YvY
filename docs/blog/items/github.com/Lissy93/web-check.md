**Note** _this list needs updating, many more jobs have been added since..._
The following section outlines the core features, and briefly explains why this data might be useful for you to know, as well as linking to further resources for learning more.
**IP Info**
###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description)
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network / the internet. The IP associated with a given domain can be found by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for the domain's A (address) record.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases)
Finding the IP of a given server is the first step to conducting further investigations, as it allows us to probe the server for additional info. Including creating a detailed map of a target's network infrastructure, pinpointing the physical location of a server, identifying the hosting service, and even discovering other domains that are hosted on the same IP address.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-1)
SSL certificates are digital certificates that authenticate the identity of a website or server, enable secure encrypted communication (HTTPS), and establish trust between clients and servers. A valid SSL certificate is required for a website to be able to use the HTTPS protocol, and encrypt user + site data in transit. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted third parties that verify the identity and legitimacy of the certificate holder.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-1)
SSL certificates not only provide the assurance that data transmission to and from the website is secure, but they also provide valuable OSINT data. Information from an SSL certificate can include the issuing authority, the domain name, its validity period, and sometimes even organization details. This can be useful for verifying the authenticity of a website, understanding its security setup, or even for discovering associated subdomains or other services.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-2)
This task involves looking up the DNS records associated with a specific domain. DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Various types of DNS records exist, including A (address), MX (mail exchange), NS (name server), CNAME (canonical name), and TXT (text), among others.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-2)
Extracting DNS records can provide a wealth of information in an OSINT investigation. For example, A and AAAA records can disclose IP addresses associated with a domain, potentially revealing the location of servers. MX records can give clues about a domain's email provider. TXT records are often used for various administrative purposes and can sometimes inadvertently leak internal information.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-4)
Robots.txt is a file found (usually) at the root of a domain, and is used to implement the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) to indicate which pages should be ignored by which crawlers and bots. It's good practice to avoid search engine crawlers from over-loading your site, but should not be used to keep pages out of search results (use the noindex meta tag or header instead).
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-4)
It's often useful to check the robots.txt file during an investigation, as it can sometimes disclose the directories and pages that the site owner doesn't want to be indexed, potentially because they contain sensitive information, or reveal the existence of otherwise hidden or unlinked directories. Additionally, understanding crawl rules may offer insights into a website's SEO strategies.

This task traces the sequence of HTTP redirects that occur from the original URL to the final destination URL. An HTTP redirect is a response with a status code that advises the client to go to another URL. Redirects can occur for several reasons, such as URL normalization (directing to the www version of the site), enforcing HTTPS, URL shorteners, or forwarding users to a new site location.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-9)
Understanding the redirect chain can be useful for several reasons. From a security perspective, long or complicated redirect chains can be a sign of potential security risks, such as unencrypted redirects in the chain. Additionally, redirects can impact website performance and SEO, as each redirect introduces additional round-trip-time (RTT). For OSINT, understanding the redirect chain can help identify relationships between different domains or reveal the use of certain technologies or hosting providers.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-16)
This task retrieves Whois records for the target domain. Whois records are a rich source of information, including the name and contact information of the domain registrant, the domain's creation and expiration dates, the domain's nameservers, and more. The information is usually obtained through a query to a Whois database server.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-16)
In an OSINT context, Whois records can provide valuable clues about the entity behind a website. They can show when the domain was first registered and when it's set to expire, which could provide insights into the operational timeline of the entity. The contact information, though often redacted or anonymized, can sometimes lead to additional avenues of investigation. The nameservers could also be used to link together multiple domains owned by the same entity.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-18)
Without DNSSEC, it's possible for MITM attackers to spoof records and lead users to phishing sites. This is because the DNS system includes no built-in methods to verify that the response to the request was not forged, or that any other part of the process wasn‚Äôt interrupted by an attacker. The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) secures DNS lookups by signing your DNS records using public keys, so browsers can detect if the response has been tampered with. Another solution to this issue is DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLD).
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-18)
DNSSEC information provides insight into an organization's level of cybersecurity maturity and potential vulnerabilities, particularly around DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. If no DNS secururity (DNSSEC, DoH, DoT, etc) is implemented, this may provide an entry point for an attacker.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-20)
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism that helps protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. A website can be included in the HSTS preload list by conforming to a set of requirements and then submitting itself to the list.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-20)
There are several reasons why it's important for a site to be HSTS enabled: 1. User bookmarks or manually types <http://example.com> and is subject to a man-in-the-middle attacker HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain 2. Web application that is intended to be purely HTTPS inadvertently contains HTTP links or serves content over HTTP HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain 3. A man-in-the-middle attacker attempts to intercept traffic from a victim user using an invalid certificate and hopes the user will accept the bad certificate HSTS does not allow a user to override the invalid certificate message

The security.txt file tells researchers how they can responsibly disclose any security issues found on your site. The standard was proposed in RFC 9116, and specifies that this file should include a point of contact (email address), as well as optionally other info, like a link to the security disclosure policy, PGP key, proffered language, policy expiry and more. The file should be located at the root of your domain, either at /security.txt or /.well-known/security.txt.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-24)
This is important, as without a defined point of contact a security researcher may be unable to report a critical security issue, or may use insecure or possibly public channels to do so. From an OSINT perspective, you may also glean info about a site including their posture on security, their CSAF provider, and meta data from the PGP public key.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-27)
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance): DMARC is an email authentication protocol that works with SPF and DKIM to prevent email spoofing and phishing. It allows domain owners to specify how to handle unauthenticated mail via a published policy in DNS, and provides a way for receiving mail servers to send feedback about emails' compliance to the sender. BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification): BIMI is an emerging email standard that enables organizations to display a logo in their customers' email clients automatically. BIMI ties the logo to the domain's DMARC record, providing another level of visual assurance to recipients that the email is legitimate. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM is an email security standard designed to make sure that messages were not altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers. It uses digital signatures linked to the domain of the sender to verify the sender and ensure message integrity. SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an email authentication method designed to prevent email spoofing. It specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain by creating a DNS record. This helps protect against spam by providing a way for receiving mail servers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-27)
This information is helpful for researchers as it helps assess a domain's email security posture, uncover potential vulnerabilities, and verify the legitimacy of emails for phishing detection. These details can also provide insight into the hosting environment, potential service providers, and the configuration patterns of a target organization, assisting in investigative efforts.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-28)
A WAF or web application firewall helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-28)
It's useful to understand if a site is using a WAF, and which firewall software / service it is using, as this provides an insight into the sites protection against several attack vectors, but also may reveal vulnerabilities in the firewall itself.

###### Description
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#description-29)
Correctly configured security HTTP headers adds a layer of protection against common attacks to your site. The main headers to be aware of are: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Enforces the use of HTTPS, mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks and protocol downgrade attempts. Content Security Policy (CSP): Constrains web page resources to prevent cross-site scripting and data injection attacks. X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type, curbing MIME-type confusion attacks. X-Frame-Options: Protects users from clickjacking attacks by controlling whether a browser should render the page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>`.
###### Use Cases
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#use-cases-29)
Reviewing security headers is important, as it offers insights into a site's defensive posture and potential vulnerabilities, enabling proactive mitigation and ensuring compliance with security best practices.

**Configuration Settings** :
Key | Value  
---|---  
`PORT` | Port to serve the API, when running server.js (e.g. `3000`)  
`API_ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT` | Enable rate-limiting for the /api endpoints (e.g. `true`)  
`API_TIMEOUT_LIMIT` | The timeout limit for API requests, in milliseconds (e.g. `10000`)  
`API_CORS_ORIGIN` | Enable CORS, by setting your allowed hostname(s) here (e.g. `example.com`)  
`CHROME_PATH` | The path the Chromium executable (e.g. `/usr/bin/chromium`)  
`DISABLE_GUI` | Disable the GUI, and only serve the API (e.g. `false`)  
`REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT` | The endpoint for the API, either local or remote (e.g. `/api`)  
All values are optional.
You can add these as environmental variables. Either put them directly into an `.env` file in the projects root, or via the Netlify / Vercel UI, or by passing to the Docker container with the --env flag, or using your own environmental variable management system
Note that keys that are prefixed with `REACT_APP_` are used client-side, and as such they must be scoped correctly with minimum privileges, since may be made visible when intercepting browser <-> server network requests
### Developing
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#developing)
  1. Clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/web-check.git`
  2. Cd into it, `cd web-check`
  3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
  4. Start the dev server, with `yarn dev`


You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (V 18.16.1 or later) installed, plus [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) as well as [git](https://git-scm.com/). Some checks also require `chromium`, `traceroute` and `dns` to be installed within your environment. These jobs will just be skipped if those packages aren't present.

### Supporting
[](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check#supporting)
The app will remain 100% free and open source. But due to the amount of traffic that the hosted instance gets, the lambda function usage is costing about $25/month. Any help with covering the costs via GitHub Sponsorship would be much appreciated. It's thanks to the support of the community that this project is able to be freely available for everyone :)
