### Frequently Asked Questions
#### General
#### What is GitHub Advanced Security?
GitHub Advanced Security is the native Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solution for GitHub Enterprise and Azure DevOps. Designed to accelerate the delivery of secure software, GitHub Advanced Security adds cutting-edge tools for static analysis, software composition analysis, and secret scanning to the GitHub platform that developers already know and love. Unlike traditional application security packages that burden the software development toolchain with complex workflows that inhibit adoption, GitHub Advanced Security makes it easy for developers to find and fix vulnerabilities earlier in the software development life cycle. By adding GitHub Advanced Security to the GitHub platform, security leaders can address compliance requirements while empowering development teams to solve customer problems, surpass competitors, and reduce the time-to-value for software development projects.
#### Why choose GitHub Advanced Security instead of a third-party AppSec product?
Unlike third-party security add-ons, GitHub Advanced Security operates entirely in the native GitHub workflows that developers already know and love. By making it easier for developers to remediate vulnerabilities as they go, GitHub Advanced Security frees time for security teams to focus on critical strategies that protect businesses, customers, and communities from application-based vulnerabilities.
#### What is DevSecOps?
DevSecOps refers to a combination of the development, security, and operations tools necessary to develop software applications.
#### What is AppSec?
Application security (AppSec) is the process of finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities in applications. GitHub Advanced Security provides AppSec tools for static application security testing (SAST), which identifies vulnerabilities in the code itself. Unlike dynamic application security testing (DAST), which probes live applications for vulnerabilities, GitHub Advanced Security helps keep vulnerabilities out of production.
#### Where can I find information about the security of the GitHub platform?
The GitHub platform itself features multiple layers of [security](https://github.com/security) to keep developers and their code safe in transit and at rest.
#### Evaluation
#### Which GitHub plans are compatible with GitHub Advanced Security?
GitHub Advanced Security can be added to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) and GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) plans. If you have a free or Team account, you will need to upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise plan before you can add GitHub Advanced Security. You can also request a free trial of both GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Advanced Security; [contact sales](http://github.com/enterprise/contact) to learn more.

#### More Security Resources
#### What security features are free to use for public repositories?
As part of our mission to support the open source community and keep open source software safe and reliable for all, GitHub provides [security features](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security#about-advanced-security-features) like code scanning, secret scanning, and supply chain security tools at no charge for use with public repositories.
#### What is the GitHub Security Lab?
The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) is a team of security experts who cultivate a collaborative community where developers and security professionals come together to help secure open source software. Our mission: make open source software secure and reliable for the benefit of developers everywhere through collaboration and contributions from maintainers, developers, and security researchers around the world.
#### What is the Advisory Database, and how is it different from a CVE?
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a database of publicly disclosed information about security issues, with a unique number to identify each vulnerability. But while CVEs document vulnerabilities, they don’t tell the whole story. Unlike a CVE, entries in the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) contain additional context and remediation guidance – sourced from a global community of security experts and curated by the GitHub Security Lab – to help developers and security teams understand vulnerabilities, assess risk, and fix with confidence.
#### How can I manage and secure open source dependencies?
GitHub provides extensive [supply chain security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-supply-chain-security) tools and resources to help developers and maintainers keep open source software up-to-date and secure, including Dependabot. If you’re new to software supply chain security, the [Dependabot quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide) is a great place to begin.

Unlike a CVE, entries in the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) contain additional context and remediation guidance – sourced from a global community of security experts and curated by the GitHub Security Lab – to help developers and security teams understand vulnerabilities, assess risk, and fix with confidence.
#### How can I manage and secure open source dependencies?
GitHub provides extensive [supply chain security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-supply-chain-security) tools and resources to help developers and maintainers keep open source software up-to-date and secure, including Dependabot. If you’re new to software supply chain security, the [Dependabot quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide) is a great place to begin.
#### Where can I learn more about the security of the GitHub platform?
Visit the [GitHub Trust Center](https://github.com/trust-center) to learn more about security, privacy, compliance, and transparency.
## Footnotes
  1. Overall, the median time for developers to use Copilot Autofix to automatically commit the fix for a PR-time alert was 28 minutes, compared to 1.5 hours to resolve the same alerts manually (3x faster). For SQL injection vulnerabilities: 18 minutes compared to 3.7 hours (12x faster). Based on new code scanning alerts found by CodeQL in pull requests (PRs) on repositories with GitHub Advanced Security enabled. These are examples; your results will vary.
