  * Suppresses HTTP request logs to reduce noise


## Configuration and Customization
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#configuration-and-customization)
The project uses a `.env` file for easy configuration. Key settings include:
  * LLM selection (local or API-based)
  * API provider selection
  * Model selection for different providers
  * Token limits and buffer sizes
  * Markdown formatting options


## Output and File Handling
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#output-and-file-handling)
  1. **Raw OCR Output** : Saved as `{base_name}__raw_ocr_output.txt`
  2. **LLM Corrected Output** : Saved as `{base_name}_llm_corrected.md` or `.txt`


The script generates detailed logs of the entire process, including timing information and quality assessments.
## Requirements
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#requirements)
  * Python 3.12+
  * Tesseract OCR engine
  * PDF2Image library
  * PyTesseract
  * OpenAI API (optional)
  * Anthropic API (optional)
  * Local LLM support (optional, requires compatible GGUF model)


## Installation
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#installation)
  1. Install Pyenv and Python 3.12 (if needed):


```
# Install Pyenv and python 3.12 if needed and then use it to create venv:
if ! command -v pyenv &> /dev/null; then
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
  libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
  xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git
  git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
  echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc
fi
cd ~/.pyenv && git pull && cd -
pyenv install 3.12
```

  1. Set up the project:


```
# Use pyenv to create virtual environment:
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr  
cd llm_aided_ocr     
pyenv local 3.12
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install wheel
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  1. Install Tesseract OCR engine (if not already installed):
     * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
     * For macOS: `brew install tesseract`
     * For Windows: Download and install from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  2. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
```
USE_LOCAL_LLM=False
API_PROVIDER=OPENAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

```



## Usage
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#usage)
  1. Place your PDF file in the project directory.
  2. Update the `input_pdf_file_path` variable in the `main()` function with your PDF filename.
  3. Run the script:
```
python llm_aided_ocr.py

```

  4. The script will generate several output files, including the final post-processed text.


## How It Works
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#how-it-works)
The LLM-Aided OCR project employs a multi-step process to transform raw OCR output into high-quality, readable text:
  1. **PDF Conversion** : Converts input PDF into images using `pdf2image`.
  2. **OCR** : Applies Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.
  3. **Text Chunking** : Splits the raw OCR output into manageable chunks for processing.
  4. **Error Correction** : Each chunk undergoes LLM-based processing to correct OCR errors and improve readability.
  5. **Markdown Formatting** (Optional): Reformats the corrected text into clean, consistent Markdown.
  6. **Quality Assessment** : An LLM-based evaluation compares the final output quality to the original OCR text.


## Code Optimization
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#code-optimization)
  * **Concurrent Processing** : When using API-based models, chunks are processed concurrently to improve speed.
  * **Context Preservation** : Each chunk includes a small overlap with the previous chunk to maintain context.
  * **Adaptive Token Management** : The system dynamically adjusts the number of tokens used for LLM requests based on input size and model constraints.


## Configuration
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#configuration)
The project uses a `.env` file for configuration. Key settings include:
  * `USE_LOCAL_LLM`: Set to `True` to use a local LLM, `False` for API-based LLMs.
  * `API_PROVIDER`: Choose between "OPENAI" or "CLAUDE".
  * `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API keys for respective services.
  * `CLAUDE_MODEL_STRING`, `OPENAI_COMPLETION_MODEL`: Specify the model to use for each provider.
  * `LOCAL_LLM_CONTEXT_SIZE_IN_TOKENS`: Set the context size for local LLMs.


## Output Files
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#output-files)
The script generates several output files:
  1. `{base_name}__raw_ocr_output.txt`: Raw OCR output from Tesseract.
  2. `{base_name}_llm_corrected.md`: Final LLM-corrected and formatted text.


## Limitations and Future Improvements
[](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr#limitations-and-future-improvements)
  * The system's performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the LLM used.
  * Processing very large documents can be time-consuming and may require significant computational resources.

Thanks for your interest in my open-source project! I hope you find it useful. You might also find my commercial web apps useful, and I would really appreciate it if you checked them out:
**[YoutubeTranscriptOptimizer.com](https://youtubetranscriptoptimizer.com)** makes it really quick and easy to paste in a YouTube video URL and have it automatically generate not just a really accurate direct transcription, but also a super polished and beautifully formatted written document that can be used independently of the video.
The document basically sticks to the same material as discussed in the video, but it sounds much more like a real piece of writing and not just a transcript. It also lets you optionally generate quizzes based on the contents of the document, which can be either multiple choice or short-answer quizzes, and the multiple choice quizzes get turned into interactive HTML files that can be hosted and easily shared, where you can actually take the quiz and it will grade your answers and score the quiz for you.
**[FixMyDocuments.com](https://fixmydocuments.com/)** lets you submit any kind of document— PDFs (including scanned PDFs that require OCR), MS Word and Powerpoint files, images, audio files (mp3, m4a, etc.) —and turn them into highly optimized versions in nice markdown formatting, from which HTML and PDF versions are automatically generated. Once converted, you can also edit them directly in the site using the built-in markdown editor, where it saves a running revision history and regenerates the PDF/HTML versions.
In addition to just getting the optimized version of the document, you can also generate many other kinds of "derived documents" from the original: interactive multiple-choice quizzes that you can actually take and get graded on; slick looking presentation slides as PDF or HTML (using LaTeX and Reveal.js), an in-depth summary, a concept mind map (using Mermaid diagrams) and outline, custom lesson plans where you can select your target audience, a readability analysis and grade-level versions of your original document (good for simplifying concepts for students), Anki Flashcards that you can import directly into the Anki app or use on the site in a nice interface, and more.
