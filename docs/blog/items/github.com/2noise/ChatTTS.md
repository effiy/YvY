## Introduction
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#introduction)
Note
This repo contains the algorithm infrastructure and some simple examples.
Tip
For the extended end-user products, please refer to the index repo [Awesome-ChatTTS](https://github.com/libukai/Awesome-ChatTTS/tree/en) maintained by the community.
ChatTTS is a text-to-speech model designed specifically for dialogue scenarios such as LLM assistant.
### Supported Languages
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#supported-languages)
  * English
  * Chinese
  * Coming Soon...


### Highlights
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#highlights)
> You can refer to **[this video on Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zn4y1o7iV)** for the detailed description.
  1. **Conversational TTS** : ChatTTS is optimized for dialogue-based tasks, enabling natural and expressive speech synthesis. It supports multiple speakers, facilitating interactive conversations.
  2. **Fine-grained Control** : The model could predict and control fine-grained prosodic features, including laughter, pauses, and interjections.
  3. **Better Prosody** : ChatTTS surpasses most of open-source TTS models in terms of prosody. We provide pretrained models to support further research and development.


### Dataset & Model
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#dataset--model)
Important
The released model is for academic purposes only.
  * The main model is trained with Chinese and English audio data of 100,000+ hours.
  * The open-source version on **[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/2Noise/ChatTTS)** is a 40,000 hours pre-trained model without SFT.


### Roadmap
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#roadmap)
  * Open-source the 40k-hours-base model and spk_stats file.
  * Streaming audio generation.
  * Open-source DVAE encoder and zero shot inferring code.
  * Multi-emotion controlling.
  * ChatTTS.cpp (new repo in `2noise` org is welcomed)


### Licenses
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#licenses)
#### The Code
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#the-code)
The code is published under `AGPLv3+` license.
#### The model
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#the-model)
The model is published under `CC BY-NC 4.0` license. It is intended for educational and research use, and should not be used for any commercial or illegal purposes. The authors do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information. The information and data used in this repo, are for academic and research purposes only. The data obtained from publicly available sources, and the authors do not claim any ownership or copyright over the data.
### Disclaimer
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#disclaimer)
ChatTTS is a powerful text-to-speech system. However, it is very important to utilize this technology responsibly and ethically. To limit the use of ChatTTS, we added a small amount of high-frequency noise during the training of the 40,000-hour model, and compressed the audio quality as much as possible using MP3 format, to prevent malicious actors from potentially using it for criminal purposes. At the same time, we have internally trained a detection model and plan to open-source it in the future.

## Get Started
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#get-started)
### Clone Repo
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#clone-repo)
```
git clone https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS
cd ChatTTS
```

### Install requirements
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#install-requirements)
#### 1. Install Directly
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#1-install-directly)
```
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Install from conda
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#2-install-from-conda)
```
conda create -n chattts python=3.11
conda activate chattts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Optional: Install vLLM (Linux only)
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#optional-install-vllm-linux-only)
```
pip install safetensors vllm==0.2.7 torchaudio
```

#### Unrecommended Optional: Install TransformerEngine if using NVIDIA GPU (Linux only)
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#unrecommended-optional-install-transformerengine-if-using-nvidia-gpu-linux-only)
Warning
DO NOT INSTALL! The adaptation of TransformerEngine is currently under development and CANNOT run properly now. Only install it on developing purpose. See more details on at #672 #676
Note
The installation process is very slow.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git@stable

#### 1. How much VRAM do I need? How about infer speed?
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#1-how-much-vram-do-i-need-how-about-infer-speed)
For a 30-second audio clip, at least 4GB of GPU memory is required. For the 4090 GPU, it can generate audio corresponding to approximately 7 semantic tokens per second. The Real-Time Factor (RTF) is around 0.3.
#### 2. Model stability is not good enough, with issues such as multi speakers or poor audio quality.
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#2-model-stability-is-not-good-enough-with-issues-such-as-multi-speakers-or-poor-audio-quality)
This is a problem that typically occurs with autoregressive models (for bark and valle). It's generally difficult to avoid. One can try multiple samples to find a suitable result.
#### 3. Besides laughter, can we control anything else? Can we control other emotions?
[](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS#3-besides-laughter-can-we-control-anything-else-can-we-control-other-emotions)
In the current released model, the only token-level control units are `[laugh]`, `[uv_break]`, and `[lbreak]`. In future versions, we may open-source models with additional emotional control capabilities.
