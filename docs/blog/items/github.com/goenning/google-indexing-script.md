# Google Indexing Script
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#google-indexing-script)
Use this script to get your entire site indexed on Google in less than 48 hours. No tricks, no hacks, just a simple script and a Google API.
Important
  1. This script uses [Google Indexing API](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quickstart) and it only works on pages with either `JobPosting` or `BroadcastEvent` structured data.
  2. Indexing != Ranking. This will not help your page rank on Google, it'll just let Google know about the existence of your pages.


## Requirements
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#requirements)
  * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  * An account on [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) with the verified sites you want to index
  * An account on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/)


## Preparation
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#preparation)
  1. Follow this [guide](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/prereqs) from Google. By the end of it, you should have a project on Google Cloud with the Indexing API enabled, a service account with the `Owner` permission on your sites.
  2. Make sure you enable both [`Google Search Console API`](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/searchconsole.googleapis.com) and [`Web Search Indexing API`](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/indexing.googleapis.com) on your [Google Project ➤ API Services ➤ Enabled API & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
  3. [Download the JSON](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script/issues/2) file with the credentials of your service account and save it in the same folder as the script. The file should be named `service_account.json`


## Installation
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#installation)
### Using CLI
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#using-cli)
Install the cli globally on your machine.
```
npm i -g google-indexing-script
```

### Using the repository
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#using-the-repository)
Clone the repository to your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script.git
cd google-indexing-script
```

Install and build the project.
```
npm install
npm run build
npm i -g .
```

Note
Ensure you are using an up-to-date Node.js version, with a preference for v20 or later. Check your current version with `node -v`.
## Usage
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#usage)
With `service_account.json` _(recommended)_
Create a `.gis` directory in your home folder and move the `service_account.json` file there.
```
mkdir ~/.gis
mv service_account.json ~/.gis
```

Run the script with the domain or url you want to index.
```
gis <domain or url>
# example
gis seogets.com
```

Here are some other ways to run the script:
```
# custom path to service_account.json
gis seogets.com --path /path/to/service_account.json
# long version command
google-indexing-script seogets.com
# cloned repository
npm run index seogets.com
```

With environment variables
Open `service_account.json` and copy the `client_email` and `private_key` values.
Run the script with the domain or url you want to index.
```
GIS_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email GIS_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key gis seogets.com
```

With arguments _(not recommended)_
Open `service_account.json` and copy the `client_email` and `private_key` values.
Once you have the values, run the script with the domain or url you want to index, the client email and the private key.
```
gis seogets.com --client-email your-client-email --private-key your-private-key
```

As a npm module
You can also use the script as a [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-indexing-script) in your own project.
```
npm i google-indexing-script
```

```
import { index } from "google-indexing-script";
import serviceAccount from "./service_account.json";
index("seogets.com", {
 client_email: serviceAccount.client_email,
 private_key: serviceAccount.private_key,
})
 .then(console.log)
 .catch(console.error);
```

Read the [API documentation](https://jsdocs.io/package/google-indexing-script) for more details.
Here's an example of what you should expect:
[![](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script/raw/main/output.png)](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script/blob/main/output.png)
Important
  * Your site must have 1 or more sitemaps submitted to Google Search Console. Otherwise, the script will not be able to find the pages to index.
  * You can run the script as many times as you want. It will only index the pages that are not already indexed.
  * Sites with a large number of pages might take a while to index, be patient.


## Quota
[](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script#quota)
Depending on your account several quotas are configured for the API (see [docs](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quota-pricing#quota)). By default the script exits as soon as the rate limit is exceeded. You can configure a retry mechanism for the read requests that apply on a per minute time frame.
With environment variables
```
export GIS_QUOTA_RPM_RETRY=true
```

As a npm module
```
import { index } from 'google-indexing-script'
import serviceAccount from './service_account.json'
index('seogets.com', {
 client_email: serviceAccount.client_email,
 private_key: serviceAccount.private_key
 quota: {
  rpmRetry: true
 }
})
 .then(console.log)
 .catch(console.error)
```
