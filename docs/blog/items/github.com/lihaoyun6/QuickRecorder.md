## Installation and Usage
[](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder#installation-and-usage)
### System Requirements:
[](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder#system-requirements)
  * macOS 12.3 and Later


### Install:
[](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder#install)
Download the latest installation file [here](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder/releases/latest) or install via Homebrew:
```
brew install lihaoyun6/tap/quickrecorder
```

### Features/Usage:
[](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder#featuresusage)
  * You can use QuickRecorder to record your screens / windows / applications / mobile devices... etc.
  * QuickRecorder supports driver-free audio loopback recording, mouse highlighting, screen magnifier and many more useful features.
  * The new **"[Presenter Overlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/facetime/presenter-overlay-video-conferencing-fctm6333f4bd/mac)"** in macOS 14 was fully supported by QuickRecorder, which can overlay the camera in real time on your recording _(macOS 12/13 can only use camera floating window)_
  * QuickRecorder is able to record `HEVC with Alpha` video format, that can contain alpha channel in the output file _(currently only iMovie and FCPX support this feature)_


## Q&A
[](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder#qa)
**1. Where can I reopen the main panel after closing it?**
> Click the Dock tile or Menubar icon of QuickRecorder to reopen the main panel at any time.
**2. Why does QuickRecorder not a sandbox app?**
> QuickRecorder has no plans to be uploaded to the App Store, so it does not need to be designed as a sandbox app.
**3. How to independently control the volume of system sound and sound from microphone in other video editor?**
> QuickRecorder will merge the audio input from the microphone to the main audio track after recording by default. If you need to edit the video, you can turn off the `Record Microphone to Main Track` option in the settings panel. After turning off, the system sound and sound from microphone will be recorded into two audio tracks and can be edited independently.
