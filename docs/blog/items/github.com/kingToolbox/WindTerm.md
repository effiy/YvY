# Terminal Performance
[](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm#terminal-performance)
The hardware used for generating the data in these benchmarks was
```

```

**WindTerm 1.72, rxvt, putty, xterm, Windows Terminal** tests are performed on WSL(Ubuntu 18.04.2).
**Iterm2, kitty, Alacritty** tests are performed on MacOS shell,
```
For WindTerm: No color scheme used in windterm. Color scheme will result in approximately 2% loss and more memory usage.
For Alacritty: Only supports up to 100,000 scrollback lines, so every test use "history: 100000" setting and no memory usage measured.
For Windows Terminal: Only supports up to 65,535 scrollback lines, so every test use "historySize: 65535" setting and no memory usage measured. 

```

# Linux Terminal Performance
[](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm#linux-terminal-performance)
The hardware used for generating the data in these benchmarks was
```
Debian 10 Vm - 4cpu and 4GB memory.
For WindTerm: No color scheme used in windterm. Color scheme will result in approximately 2% loss and more memory usage.
For other terminals: No memory usage measured because most of them write the history to disk or only support a limited number of lines in memory..

```

The version of terminals:
Application | Version | Release Date  
---|---|---  
Windterm | v1.9 | 2020-12-22  
Gnome | v3.30.2 | 2018-10-22

**All test data is for reference only.**
## Test Command: "cat ./benchmark_randomdata"
[](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm#test-command-cat-benchmark_randomdata-1)
The benchmark_randomdata contains 97.6MB random text (102,401,504 bytes, 1,329,878 lines, generated and tested by [random_test.sh](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm/blob/master/benchmark/urandom_test.sh))
In all cases, three runs were made to warm system caches. The reported numbers are the median of five runs.
