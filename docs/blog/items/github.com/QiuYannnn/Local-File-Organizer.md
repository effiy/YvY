## Updates 🚀
[](https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer#updates-)
**[2024/09] v0.0.2** :
  * Featured by [Nexa Gallery](https://nexaai.com/gallery) and [Nexa SDK Cookbook](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/examples)!
  * Dry Run Mode: check sorting results before committing changes
  * Silent Mode: save all logs to a txt file for quieter operation
  * Added file support: `.md`, .`excel`, `.ppt`, and `.csv`
  * Three sorting options: by content, by date, and by type
  * The default text model is now [Llama3.2 3B](https://nexaai.com/meta/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct/gguf-q3_K_M/file)
  * Improved CLI interaction experience
  * Added real-time progress bar for file analysis


Please update the project by deleting the original project folder and reinstalling the requirements. Refer to the installation guide from Step 4.
## Roadmap 📅
[](https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer#roadmap-)
  * Copilot Mode: chat with AI to tell AI how you want to sort the file (ie. read and rename all the PDFs)
  * Change models with CLI
  * ebook format support
  * audio file support
  * video file support
  * Implement best practices like Johnny Decimal
  * Check file duplication
  * Dockerfile for easier installation
  * People from [Nexa](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk) is helping me to make executables for macOS, Linux and Windows


## What It Does 🔍
[](https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer#what-it-does-)
This intelligent file organizer harnesses the power of advanced AI models, including language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), to automate the process of organizing files by:
  * Scanning a specified input directory for files.
  * Content Understanding:
    * **Textual Analysis** : Uses the [Llama3.2 3B](https://nexaai.com/meta/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct/gguf-q3_K_M/file) to analyze and summarize text-based content, generating relevant descriptions and filenames.
    * **Visual Content Analysis** : Uses the [LLaVA-v1.6](https://nexaai.com/liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-vicuna-7b/gguf-q4_0/file) , based on Vicuna-7B, to interpret visual files such as images, providing context-aware categorization and descriptions.
  * Understanding the content of your files (text, images, and more) to generate relevant descriptions, folder names, and filenames.
  * Organizing the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata.


The best part? All AI processing happens 100% on your local device using the [Nexa SDK](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk). No internet connection required, no data leaves your computer, and no AI API is needed - keeping your files completely private and secure.

```
python main.py
```

## Notes
[](https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer#notes)
  * **SDK Models:**
    * The script uses `NexaVLMInference` and `NexaTextInference` models [usage](https://docs.nexaai.com/sdk/python-interface/gguf).
    * Ensure you have access to these models and they are correctly set up.
    * You may need to download model files or configure paths.
  * **Dependencies:**
    * **pytesseract:** Requires Tesseract OCR installed on your system. 
      * **macOS:** `brew install tesseract`
      * **Ubuntu/Linux:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
      * **Windows:** Download from [Tesseract OCR Windows Installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
    * **PyMuPDF (fitz):** Used for reading PDFs.
  * **Processing Time:**
    * Processing may take time depending on the number and size of files.
    * The script uses multiprocessing to improve performance.
  * **Customizing Prompts:**
    * You can adjust prompts in `data_processing.py` to change how metadata is generated.
