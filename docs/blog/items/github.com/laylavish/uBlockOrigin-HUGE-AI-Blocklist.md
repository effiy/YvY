# uBlockOrigin & uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#ublockorigin--ublacklist-huge-ai-blocklist)
A huge blocklist of manually curated sites (1000+) that contain AI generated content, for the purposes of cleaning image search engines (Google Search, DuckDuckGo, and Bing) with uBlock Origin or uBlacklist.
Also works on mobile ([iOS, iPadOS,](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#iOS-iPadOS-Safari-only) [Android](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#Android-via-Firefox)) via uBlacklist, as well as pihole/adguard (via [Hosts file](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#hosts-file-for-pi-holeadguard))
Warning
Right now, please use [uBlacklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#Installing-it-with-uBlacklist) _instead_ of uBlock Origin for now. Needs a little restructuring to fix DOM targeting. You can still try uBlock, but it will probably not work as you expect it to...
## Installing the blocklist for for PC/Desktop
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#installing-the-blocklist-for-for-pcdesktop)
### Installing it with uBlock Origin
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#installing-it-with-ublock-origin)
**One-click import (any platform)**
If you have uBlock Origin installed, click [this link](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flaylavish%2FuBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist%2Fmain%2Flist.txt&title=Sites%20using%20AI%20generated%20content) to import the filter list in just a click! Quick and simple.
**Manual Import**
  1. Make sure that you have the uBlock Origin Extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), or any browser that supports uBlock Origin
  2. Click on the uBlock Origin Extension, and in the bottom right, there is a cog-wheel symbol--named the dashboard. Click it.
  3. Once you are in the dashboard, look towards the top. Click on the tab that says "Filter lists".
  4. Look towards the bottom, and expand the `Import` button.
  5. Copy and paste this URL into the dialogue box:


```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list.txt

```

  1. Apply changes, and you're set!

Here's a video guide on how to do this (click the dropdown to expand)  video.mp4
Tip
uBlock Origin will automatically refresh the filter list once a day, so you'll always have up-to-date filters. If you want to force an update of the filter list, pressing the stopwatch next to the newly added list, then pressing `Update now` will achieve that.
Important
If you find that your imported list isn't working, it may be due to an outdated web browsing session. If your web browser hasn't been closed in a long time, there's a chance the session won't update how it should. This means importing the list into uBlock Origin or uBlacklist won't function correctly. Try creating a new session, aka closing **all** web browser windows, waiting until all processes are fully closed (4-5 second wait), then re-open your web browser. That should fix it. If not, then try clearing your browser's cache.
### Installing it with uBlacklist
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#installing-it-with-ublacklist)
**One-click filter import (Only for Chrome, Firefox doesn't support one-click import)**
If you use Google Chrome/Chromium and have [uBlacklist installed](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe), you can import the list in just one click. Click [this link](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name=Main+AI+Blocklist&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list_uBlacklist.txt) to automatically subscribe to the list.
**Manual Import**
  1. Make sure that you have the uBlacklist extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe), or any browser that supports uBlacklist
  2. Click on your extensions list, select uBlacklist, then click on the "options" text, highlighted in blue.
  3. Enable the **Other search engines** , and click on the search engine(s) you want this list to work on. A list of compatible search engines (with images support) is [here.](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-search-engines)
  4. Scroll all the way down until you see the "Subscription" tab, and click on the blue "Add a subscription" button.
  5. Give a name for the added blocklist (eg. Main AI blocklist).
  6. Copy and paste this url


```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list_uBlacklist.txt

```

into the **URL** part of the dialogue box, then press the blue **Add** button.
  1. Set the update interval to an hour for near-realtime list updates, and you're done!


## Installing the blocklist for mobile (iOS, iPadOS & Android)
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#installing-the-blocklist-for-mobile-ios-ipados--android)
### iOS, iPadOS (Safari only)
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#ios-ipados-safari-only)
Note
Both iOS and iPadOS don't have support for uBlock Origin. So, we'll be using uBlacklist for this. Plus, Safari is the only browser we can use since it allows the use of extensions.
  1. Download uBlacklist, [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ublacklist-for-safari/id1547912640)
  2. Go into settings, scroll down until you see Safari, and tap on it.
  3. Once in the Safari settings, in General, hit **Extensions**. Turn on the uBlacklist extension.
  4. While still in uBlacklist's settings, in the **Permissions for uBlacklist** section, scroll down to your preferred search engine and change the permission from "Ask" to "Allow."


Important
This may look cumbersome, but all you really need to do is just allow the extension to hit your search engine's locale, for example, `google.fr` or `google.co.uk`. You can go through all of them and allow them, but it's not really necessary.
  1. Now scroll back up, and hit the blue **Extension Settings** button. It will bring you to Safari and open uBlacklist's settings panel.
  2. Scroll all the way down until you see the "Subscription" tab, and click on the blue "Add a subscription" button.
  3. Give a name for the added blocklist (eg. Main AI blocklist).
  4. Copy and paste this url


```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/list_uBlacklist.txt

```

into the **URL** part of the dialogue box, then press the blue **Add** button.
  1. Set the update interval to an hour for near-realtime list updates, and you're done!

## Hosts file for pi-hole/adguard
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#hosts-file-for-pi-holeadguard)
I've added a list in HOSTS format for pi-hole/adguard or for use in your own operating system's hosts file.
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/main/noai_hosts.txt

```

For use in your operating system, visit the url and copy-paste the contents inside your operating systems hosts file.
Here's a simple guide on how to [access your hosts file on Linux, macOS, and Windows.](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/)
### For pi-hole:
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#for-pi-hole)
  1. Visit your admin's dashboard
  2. Click on `Adlists`
  3. Copy and paste the url into the `address:` box
  4. Hit the `add` button, and it should be added.


### For Adguard:
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#for-adguard)
  1. Open Adguard Home Dashboard
  2. Go to filters --> DNS blocklists.
  3. Click `Add blocklist`, then `Add a custom list`.
  4. Enter the name of the list (eg. AI blocklist) into the first dialogue box.
  5. Copy and paste the url into the second dialogue box.
  6. Hit save, and the list is added!


## Additional lists
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#additional-lists)
As of right now, there are two lists. The [main](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/blob/main/github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/blob/main/list.txt) default list, and the [nuclear](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/blob/main/github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/blob/main/additional_list_nuclear.txt) list.
The nuclear list has sites that contain a mix of authentic and AI generated imagery (eg. DeviantArt, Artstation, Stock Photography sites, etc), which make it tricky to outright block in the main filter list, so I've designated it to a separate list that you can toggle on and off if you so desire.

## Allowlisting sites
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#allowlisting-sites)
Don't like a website being blocked? You can easily create an allowlist in your own personal uBlock Origin or uBlacklist filter list.
Here's how to do it.
Steps for uBlock Origin (expand) 
  1. Toggle the [DOM inspector](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/DOM-inspector) `</>` through uBlock Origin's [logger](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger).
  2. Locate the URL you want to allowlist.
  3. Click on the filter you want to disable (eg. vecteezy.com); it should then be crossed out.
  4. Press the save icon, then the "Create" button.


Boom! Now it's allowlisted!
Or, if you don't want to go through that mumbo-jumbo, add this line in your filter list:
```
#@#a[href*="example.com"]:upward(div):style(opacity:0.00!important;)

```

Change "example.com" to the URL you want to allowlist. Copy & paste that in uBlock Origin's "My filters" list, and you're set!
Steps for uBlacklist (expand) 
  1. Enter uBlacklist's options panel.
  2. In the text box, add this line in the text box:


```
@*://*.example.com/*

```

  1. Change "example.com" to a website you want allowlisted.
  2. Click save. Done!


## Extended Filtering
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#extended-filtering)
It is possible to filter AI results based on keywords. It was originally in the list, but it's been taken out to make it configurable and/or optional (since it is a blanket ruling, and doesn't care about context).
### uBlock Origin
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#ublock-origin)
In your personal filter list, you can use this template to add your own keywords you would like to block.
```
google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div>a:has-text(/Your Text Here/i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)

```

Replace "Your Text Here" with your preferred keywords. A short list of **optional** procedural filters that you can use for uBlock Origin are listed in a dropdown below:
Optional procedural filters for uBlock Origin 
```
google.com,duckduckgo.com,bing.com##div>a:has-text(/Stable Diffusion/i):upward(div):style(opacity:0!important)

### uBlacklist
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#ublacklist)
For uBlacklist, you can use [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to filter AI results based on keywords.
An example of a regular expression for uBlacklist would be: `/ai *(generated)?|stable *diffusion/i`
Below is a small list of **optional** regular expressions that can be used to filter out AI results based on keywords:
Optional regular expressions for uBlacklist 
```
/(generative)? *AI *(art|generated|illustration)?/i
/(ada)?Lo(RA|Con) *(model)?|(stable)?.*diffusion|midjourney|niji|sd *(xl|1.5)|(text|txt|img|image) *(to|2) *(image|img|video)/i

```

## What's the difference between uBlock Origin and uBlacklist anyway?
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#whats-the-difference-between-ublock-origin-and-ublacklist-anyway)
Currently uBlacklist has an issue with pagination on Google Images. This means that if too many AI images are blocked on a single page, you won't be able to scroll further down to load more. This is rare, although it can happen.
uBlock Origin does not have this issue since it is only changing the opacity of the divs instead of blocking them, although this makes image search look a little strange since there will be gaps where the images are "blocked."
If uBlock Origin doesn't work, try uBlacklist (and vise versa). Try out each of them and see which one works better for you! :)
## To Do
[](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist#to-do)
  * Provide blocklist for uBlacklist compatibility
  * Blocklist functionality on DuckDuckGo and Bing (ew)
  * Create hosts file for pi-hole/adguard
  * Startpage, Ecosia, Brave support (for uBlock Origin)
