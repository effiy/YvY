[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#-)
fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-preview.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-preview.png)
It's an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want.

The install script will add lines to your shell configuration file to modify `$PATH` and set up shell integration.
### Binary releases
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#binary-releases)
You can download the official fzf binaries from the releases page.
  * <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases>


### Setting up shell integration
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#setting-up-shell-integration)
Add the following line to your shell configuration file.
  * bash 
```
# Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
eval "$(fzf --bash)"
```

  * zsh 
```
# Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
source <(fzf --zsh)
```

  * fish 
```
# Set up fzf key bindings
fzf --fish | source
```



Note
`--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are only available in fzf 0.48.0 or later. If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can source individual script files in the [/shell](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/shell) directory. The location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use. Please refer to the package documentation for more information. (e.g. `apt show fzf`)
Tip
You can disable CTRL-T or ALT-C binding by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` or `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script. For example, to disable ALT-C binding:
  * bash: `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval "$(fzf --bash)"`
  * zsh: `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)`
  * fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`


Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.
### Vim/Neovim plugin
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#vimneovim-plugin)
If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to your Vim configuration file:
```
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

  * `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions 
    * `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary
  * `junegunn/fzf.vim` is [a separate project](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) that provides a variety of useful commands


To learn more about the Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README-VIM.md).
Tip
If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).
## Upgrading fzf
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#upgrading-fzf)
fzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a while. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation method used.
  * git: `cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install`
  * brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`
  * macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`
  * chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`
  * vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`


## Building fzf
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#building-fzf)
See [BUILD.md](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/BUILD.md).
## Usage
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage)
fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the selected item to STDOUT.
```
find * -type f | fzf > selected
```

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current directory to get the list of files.
```
vim $(fzf)
```

Note
You can override the default behavior
  * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list
  * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`


Warning
A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we've presented the above as it's easier to grasp
```
fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim
```

Tip
fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.
```
fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'
```

_See[Turning into a different process](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#turning-into-a-different-process) for more information._
### Using the finder
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#using-the-finder)
  * `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down
  * `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit
  * On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items
  * Emacs style key bindings
  * Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on multi-select mode


### Display modes
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#display-modes)
fzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.
#### `--height` mode
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#--height-mode)
With `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.
```
fzf --height 40%
```

`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.
```
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border
```

By prepending `~` to the height, you're setting the maximum height.
```
# Will take as few lines as possible to display the list
seq 3 | fzf --height ~100%
seq 3000 | fzf --height ~100%
```

Height value can be a negative number.
```
# Screen height - 3
fzf --height -3
```

#### `--tmux` mode
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#--tmux-mode)
With `--tmux` option, fzf will start in a tmux popup.
```
# --tmux [center|top|bottom|left|right][,SIZE[%]][,SIZE[%][,border-native]]
fzf --tmux center     # Center, 50% width and height
fzf --tmux 80%      # Center, 80% width and height
fzf --tmux 100%,50%    # Center, 100% width and 50% height
fzf --tmux left,40%    # Left, 40% width
fzf --tmux left,40%,90%  # Left, 40% width, 90% height
fzf --tmux top,40%    # Top, 40% height
fzf --tmux bottom,80%,40% # Bottom, 80% height, 40% height
```

`--tmux` is silently ignored when you're not on tmux.
Note
If you're stuck with an old version of tmux that doesn't support popup, or if you want to open fzf in a regular tmux pane, check out [fzf-tmux](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/bin/fzf-tmux) script.
Tip
You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they're applied by default. For example,
```
# Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top'
```

### Search syntax
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#search-syntax)
Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in "extended-search mode" where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire`
Token | Match type | Description  
---|---|---  
`sbtrkt` | fuzzy-match | Items that match `sbtrkt`  
`'wild` | exact-match (quoted) | Items that include `wild`  
`'wild'` | exact-boundary-match (quoted both ends) | Items that include `wild` at word boundaries  
`^music` | prefix-exact-match | Items that start with `music`  
`.mp3$` | suffix-exact-match | Items that end with `.mp3`  
`!fire` | inverse-exact-match | Items that do not include `fire`  
`!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `music`  
`!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.mp3`  
If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" every word, start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when `--exact` is set, `'`-prefix "unquotes" the term.
A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`, or `py`.
```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$

```

### Environment variables
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables)
  * `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
    * Default command to use when input is tty
    * e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f'`
  * `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`
    * Default options
    * e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="--layout=reverse --inline-info"`
  * `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`
    * If you prefer to manage default options in a file, set this variable to point to the location of the file
    * e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE=~/.fzfrc`


Warning
`FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is not used by shell integration due to the slight difference in requirements.
  * `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to get a list of files and directories
  * `ALT-C` runs `$FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to get a list of directories
  * `vim ~/**<tab>` runs `fzf_compgen_path()` with the prefix (`~/`) as the first argument
  * `cd foo**<tab>` runs `fzf_compgen_dir()` with the prefix (`foo`) as the first argument


The available options are described later in this document.
### Customizing the look
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#customizing-the-look)
The user interface of fzf is fully customizable with a large number of configuration options. For a quick setup, you can start with one of the style presets ‚Äî `default`, `full`, or `minimal` ‚Äî using the `--style` option.
```
fzf --style full \
  --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}' --bind 'focus:transform-header:file --brief {}'
```

Preset | Screenshot  
---|---  
`default` | [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-default.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-default.png)  
`full` | [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-full.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-full.png)  
`minimal` | [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-minimal.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-minimal.png)  
Here's an example based on the `full` preset:
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-4-borders.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-4-borders.png)
```
git ls-files | fzf --style full \
  --border --padding 1,2 \
  --border-label ' Demo ' --input-label ' Input ' --header-label ' File Type ' \
  --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}' \
  --bind 'result:transform-list-label:
    if [[ -z $FZF_QUERY ]]; then
     echo " $FZF_MATCH_COUNT items "
    else
     echo " $FZF_MATCH_COUNT matches for [$FZF_QUERY] "
    fi
    ' \
  --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:[[ -n {} ]] && printf " Previewing [%s] " {}' \
  --bind 'focus:+transform-header:file --brief {} || echo "No file selected"' \
  --bind 'ctrl-r:change-list-label( Reloading the list )+reload(sleep 2; git ls-files)' \
  --color 'border:#aaaaaa,label:#cccccc' \
  --color 'preview-border:#9999cc,preview-label:#ccccff' \
  --color 'list-border:#669966,list-label:#99cc99' \
  --color 'input-border:#996666,input-label:#ffcccc' \
  --color 'header-border:#6699cc,header-label:#99ccff'
```

## Key bindings for command-line
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#key-bindings-for-command-line)
By [setting up shell integration](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#setting-up-shell-integration), you can use the following key bindings in bash, zsh, and fish.
  * `CTRL-T` - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line 
    * The list is generated using `--walker file,dir,follow,hidden` option 
      * You can override the behavior by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to a custom command that generates the desired list
      * Or you can set `--walker*` options in `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS`
    * Set `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf 
```
# Preview file content using bat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS="
 --walker-skip .git,node_modules,target
 --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}'
 --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(down|hidden|)'"
```

    * Can be disabled by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script
  * `CTRL-R` - Paste the selected command from history onto the command-line 
    * If you want to see the commands in chronological order, press `CTRL-R` again which toggles sorting by relevance
    * Press `CTRL-/` or `ALT-/` to toggle line wrapping
    * Set `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf 
```
# CTRL-Y to copy the command into clipboard using pbcopy
export FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS="
 --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {2..} | pbcopy)+abort'
 --color header:italic
 --header 'Press CTRL-Y to copy command into clipboard'"
```

  * `ALT-C` - cd into the selected directory 
    * The list is generated using `--walker dir,follow,hidden` option
    * Set `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to override the default command 
      * Or you can set `--walker-*` options in `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS`
    * Set `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf 
```
# Print tree structure in the preview window
export FZF_ALT_C_OPTS="
 --walker-skip .git,node_modules,target
 --preview 'tree -C {}'"
```

    * Can be disabled by setting `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script


Display modes for these bindings can be separately configured via `FZF_{CTRL_T,CTRL_R,ALT_C}_OPTS` or globally via `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`. (e.g. `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS='--tmux bottom,60% --height 60% --border top'`)
More tips can be found on [the wiki page](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Configuring-shell-key-bindings).
## Fuzzy completion for bash and zsh
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fuzzy-completion-for-bash-and-zsh)
### Files and directories
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#files-and-directories)
Fuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before the cursor ends with the trigger sequence, which is by default `**`.
  * `COMMAND [DIRECTORY/][FUZZY_PATTERN]**<TAB>`


```
# Files under the current directory
# - You can select multiple items with TAB key
vim **<TAB>
# Files under parent directory
vim ../**<TAB>
# Files under parent directory that match `fzf`
vim ../fzf**<TAB>
# Files under your home directory
vim ~/**<TAB>

# Directories under current directory (single-selection)
cd **<TAB>
# Directories under ~/github that match `fzf`
cd ~/github/fzf**<TAB>
```

### Process IDs
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#process-ids)
Fuzzy completion for PIDs is provided for kill command.
```
# Can select multiple processes with <TAB> or <Shift-TAB> keys
kill -9 **<TAB>
```

### Host names
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#host-names)
For ssh and telnet commands, fuzzy completion for hostnames is provided. The names are extracted from /etc/hosts and ~/.ssh/config.
```
ssh **<TAB>
telnet **<TAB>
```

### Environment variables / Aliases
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables--aliases)
```
unset **<TAB>
export **<TAB>
unalias **<TAB>
```

### Customizing fzf options for completion
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#customizing-fzf-options-for-completion)
```
# Use ~~ as the trigger sequence instead of the default **
export FZF_COMPLETION_TRIGGER='~~'
# Options to fzf command
export FZF_COMPLETION_OPTS='--border --info=inline'
# Options for path completion (e.g. vim **<TAB>)
export FZF_COMPLETION_PATH_OPTS='--walker file,dir,follow,hidden'
# Options for directory completion (e.g. cd **<TAB>)
export FZF_COMPLETION_DIR_OPTS='--walker dir,follow'
# Advanced customization of fzf options via _fzf_comprun function
# - The first argument to the function is the name of the command.
# - You should make sure to pass the rest of the arguments ($@) to fzf.
_fzf_comprun() {
 local command=$1
 shift
 case "$command" in
  cd)      fzf --preview 'tree -C {} | head -200'  "$@" ;;
  export|unset) fzf --preview "eval 'echo \$'{}"     "$@" ;;
  ssh)     fzf --preview 'dig {}'          "$@" ;;
  *)      fzf --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}' "$@" ;;
 esac
}
```

### Customizing completion source for paths and directories
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#customizing-completion-source-for-paths-and-directories)
```
# Use fd (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for listing path candidates.
# - The first argument to the function ($1) is the base path to start traversal
# - See the source code (completion.{bash,zsh}) for the details.
_fzf_compgen_path() {
 fd --hidden --follow --exclude ".git" . "$1"
}
# Use fd to generate the list for directory completion
_fzf_compgen_dir() {
 fd --type d --hidden --follow --exclude ".git" . "$1"
}
```

### Supported commands
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#supported-commands)
On bash, fuzzy completion is enabled only for a predefined set of commands (`complete | grep _fzf` to see the list). But you can enable it for other commands as well by using `_fzf_setup_completion` helper function.
```
# usage: _fzf_setup_completion path|dir|var|alias|host COMMANDS...
_fzf_setup_completion path ag git kubectl
_fzf_setup_completion dir tree
```

### Custom fuzzy completion
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#custom-fuzzy-completion)
_**(Custom completion API is experimental and subject to change)**_
For a command named _"COMMAND"_ , define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND` function using `_fzf_complete` helper.
```
# Custom fuzzy completion for "doge" command
#  e.g. doge **<TAB>
_fzf_complete_doge() {
 _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --prompt="doge> " -- "$@" < <(
  echo very
  echo wow
  echo such
  echo doge
 )
}
```

  * The arguments before `--` are the options to fzf.
  * After `--`, simply pass the original completion arguments unchanged (`"$@"`).
  * Then, write a set of commands that generates the completion candidates and feed its output to the function using process substitution (`< <(...)`).


zsh will automatically pick up the function using the naming convention but in bash you have to manually associate the function with the command using the `complete` command.
```
[ -n "$BASH" ] && complete -F _fzf_complete_doge -o default -o bashdefault doge
```

If you need to post-process the output from fzf, define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND_post` as follows.
```
_fzf_complete_foo() {
 _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --header-lines=3 -- "$@" < <(
  ls -al
 )
}
_fzf_complete_foo_post() {
 awk '{print $NF}'
}
[ -n "$BASH" ] && complete -F _fzf_complete_foo -o default -o bashdefault foo
```

## Vim plugin
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#vim-plugin)
See [README-VIM.md](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README-VIM.md).
## Advanced topics
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#advanced-topics)
### Customizing for different types of input
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#customizing-for-different-types-of-input)
Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter, its algorithm was designed to "generally" work well with any kind of input. However, admittedly, there is no true one-size-fits-all solution, and you may want to tweak the algorithm and some of the settings depending on the type of the input. To make this process easier, fzf provides a set of "scheme"s for some common input types.
Scheme | Description  
---|---  
`--scheme=default` | Generic scheme designed to work well with any kind of input  
`--scheme=path` | Suitable for file paths  
`--scheme=history` | Suitable for command history or any input where chronological ordering is important  
(See `fzf --man` for the details)
### Performance
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#performance)
fzf is fast. Performance should not be a problem in most use cases. However, you might want to be aware of the options that can affect performance.
  * `--ansi` tells fzf to extract and parse ANSI color codes in the input, and it makes the initial scanning slower. So it's not recommended that you add it to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`.
  * `--nth` makes fzf slower because it has to tokenize each line.
  * A plain string `--delimiter` should be preferred over a regular expression delimiter.
  * `--with-nth` makes fzf slower as fzf has to tokenize and reassemble each line.


### Executing external programs
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#executing-external-programs)
You can set up key bindings for starting external processes without leaving fzf (`execute`, `execute-silent`).
```
# Press F1 to open the file with less without leaving fzf
# Press CTRL-Y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts fzf (requires pbcopy)
fzf --bind 'f1:execute(less -f {}),ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort'
```

See _KEY BINDINGS_ section of the man page for details.
### Turning into a different process
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#turning-into-a-different-process)
`become(...)` is similar to `execute(...)`/`execute-silent(...)` described above, but instead of executing the command and coming back to fzf on complete, it turns fzf into a new process for the command.
```
fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'
```

Compared to the seemingly equivalent command substitution `vim "$(fzf)"`, this approach has several advantages:
  * Vim will not open an empty file when you terminate fzf with `CTRL-C`
  * Vim will not open an empty file when you press `ENTER` on an empty result
  * Can handle multiple selections even when they have whitespaces 
```
fzf --multi --bind 'enter:become(vim {+})'
```



To be fair, running `fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim` instead of `vim "$(fzf)"` resolves all of the issues mentioned. Nonetheless, `become(...)` still offers additional benefits in different scenarios.
  * You can set up multiple bindings to handle the result in different ways without any wrapping script 
```
fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {}),ctrl-e:become(emacs {})'
```

    * Previously, you would have to use `--expect=ctrl-e` and check the first line of the output of fzf
  * You can easily build the subsequent command using the field index expressions of fzf 
```
# Open the file in Vim and go to the line
git grep --line-number . |
  fzf --delimiter : --nth 3.. --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
```



### Reloading the candidate list
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#reloading-the-candidate-list)
By binding `reload` action to a key or an event, you can make fzf dynamically reload the candidate list. See [#1750](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750) for more details.
#### 1. Update the list of processes by pressing CTRL-R
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#1-update-the-list-of-processes-by-pressing-ctrl-r)
```
ps -ef |
 fzf --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' \
   --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' --header-lines=1 \
   --height=50% --layout=reverse
```

#### 2. Switch between sources by pressing CTRL-D or CTRL-F
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#2-switch-between-sources-by-pressing-ctrl-d-or-ctrl-f)
```
FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='find . -type f' \
 fzf --bind 'ctrl-d:reload(find . -type d),ctrl-f:reload(eval "$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND")' \
   --height=50% --layout=reverse
```

#### 3. Interactive ripgrep integration
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#3-interactive-ripgrep-integration)
The following example uses fzf as the selector interface for ripgrep. We bound `reload` action to `change` event, so every time you type on fzf, the ripgrep process will restart with the updated query string denoted by the placeholder expression `{q}`. Also, note that we used `--disabled` option so that fzf doesn't perform any secondary filtering.
```
: | rg_prefix='rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case' \
  fzf --bind 'start:reload:$rg_prefix ""' \
    --bind 'change:reload:$rg_prefix {q} || true' \
    --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})' \
    --ansi --disabled \
    --height=50% --layout=reverse
```

If ripgrep doesn't find any matches, it will exit with a non-zero exit status, and fzf will warn you about it. To suppress the warning message, we added `|| true` to the command, so that it always exits with 0.
See ["Using fzf as interactive Ripgrep launcher"](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#using-fzf-as-interactive-ripgrep-launcher) for more sophisticated examples.
### Preview window
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window)
When the `--preview` option is set, fzf automatically starts an external process with the current line as the argument and shows the result in the split window. Your `$SHELL` is used to execute the command with `$SHELL -c COMMAND`. The window can be scrolled using the mouse or custom key bindings.
```
# {} is replaced with the single-quoted string of the focused line
fzf --preview 'cat {}'
```

Preview window supports ANSI colors, so you can use any program that syntax-highlights the content of a file, such as [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) or [Highlight](https://gitlab.com/saalen/highlight):
```
fzf --preview 'bat --color=always {}' --preview-window '~3'
```

You can customize the size, position, and border of the preview window using `--preview-window` option, and the foreground and background color of it with `--color` option. For example,
```
fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --info inline --border \
  --preview 'file {}' --preview-window up,1,border-horizontal \
  --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(50%|hidden|)' \
  --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899'
```

See the man page (`man fzf`) for the full list of options.
More advanced examples can be found [here](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md).
Warning
Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter rather than a file finder, **it is not a good idea to add`--preview` option to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`**.
```
# *********************
# ** DO NOT DO THIS! **
# *********************
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--preview "bat --style=numbers --color=always --line-range :500 {}"'
# bat doesn't work with any input other than the list of files
ps -ef | fzf
seq 100 | fzf
history | fzf
```

### Previewing an image
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#previewing-an-image)
fzf can display images in the preview window using one of the following protocols:
  * [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/)
  * [iTerm2 inline images protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)
  * [Sixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel)


See [bin/fzf-preview.sh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/bin/fzf-preview.sh) script for more information.
```
fzf --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}'
```

## Tips
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#tips)
### Respecting `.gitignore`
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#respecting-gitignore)
You can use [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), or [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) to traverse the file system while respecting `.gitignore`.
```
# Feed the output of fd into fzf
fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix | fzf
# Setting fd as the default source for fzf
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix'
# Now fzf (w/o pipe) will use the fd command to generate the list
fzf
# To apply the command to CTRL-T as well
export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND="$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND"
```

If you want the command to follow symbolic links and don't want it to exclude hidden files, use the following command:
```
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix --hidden --follow --exclude .git'
```

### Fish shell
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fish-shell)
`CTRL-T` key binding of fish, unlike those of bash and zsh, will use the last token on the command-line as the root directory for the recursive search. For instance, hitting `CTRL-T` at the end of the following command-line
```
ls /var/
```

will list all files and directories under `/var/`.
When using a custom `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND`, use the unexpanded `$dir` variable to make use of this feature. `$dir` defaults to `.` when the last token is not a valid directory. Example:
```
set -g FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND "command find -L \$dir -type f 2> /dev/null | sed '1d; s#^\./##'"
```

### fzf Theme Playground
[](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fzf-theme-playground)
[fzf Theme Playground](https://vitormv.github.io/fzf-themes/) created by [Vitor Mello](https://github.com/vitormv) is a webpage where you can interactively create fzf themes.
