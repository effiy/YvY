## 🌟 Overview ([Try VL Now!](https://videolingo.io))
[](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo#-overview-try-vl-now)
VideoLingo is an all-in-one video translation, localization, and dubbing tool aimed at generating Netflix-quality subtitles. It eliminates stiff machine translations and multi-line subtitles while adding high-quality dubbing, enabling global knowledge sharing across language barriers.
Key features:
  * 🎥 YouTube video download via yt-dlp
  * **🎙️ Word-level and Low-illusion subtitle recognition with WhisperX**
  * **📝 NLP and AI-powered subtitle segmentation**
  * **📚 Custom + AI-generated terminology for coherent translation**
  * **🔄 3-step Translate-Reflect-Adaptation for cinematic quality**
  * **✅ Netflix-standard, Single-line subtitles Only**
  * **🗣️ Dubbing with GPT-SoVITS, Azure, OpenAI, and more**
  * 🚀 One-click startup and processing in Streamlit
  * 🌍 Multi-language support in Streamlit UI
  * 📝 Detailed logging with progress resumption


Difference from similar projects: **Single-line subtitles only, superior translation quality, seamless dubbing experience**

**Input Language Support(more to come):**
🇺🇸 English 🤩 | 🇷🇺 Russian 😊 | 🇫🇷 French 🤩 | 🇩🇪 German 🤩 | 🇮🇹 Italian 🤩 | 🇪🇸 Spanish 🤩 | 🇯🇵 Japanese 😐 | 🇨🇳 Chinese* 😊
> *Chinese uses a separate punctuation-enhanced whisper model, for now...
**Translation supports all languages, while dubbing language depends on the chosen TTS method.**
## Installation
[](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo#installation)
You don't have to read the whole docs, [**here**](https://share.fastgpt.in/chat/share?shareId=066w11n3r9aq6879r4z0v9rh) is an online AI agent to help you.
> **Note:** For Windows users with NVIDIA GPU, follow these steps before installation:
>   1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.6](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda_12.6.0_560.76_windows.exe)
>   2. Install [CUDNN 9.3.0](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/9.3.0/local_installers/cudnn_9.3.0_windows.exe)
>   3. Add `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v9.3\bin\12.6` to your system PATH
>   4. Restart your computer
> 

> **Note:** FFmpeg is required. Please install it via package managers:
>   * Windows: `choco install ffmpeg` (via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/))
>   * macOS: `brew install ffmpeg` (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
>   * Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Debian/Ubuntu)
> 

  1. Clone the repository


```
git clone https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo.git
cd VideoLingo
```

  1. Install dependencies(requires `python=3.10`)


```
conda create -n videolingo python=3.10.0 -y
conda activate videolingo
python install.py
```

  1. Start the application


```
streamlit run st.py
```

### Docker
[](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo#docker)
Alternatively, you can use Docker (requires CUDA 12.4 and NVIDIA Driver version >550), see [Docker docs](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo/blob/main/docs/pages/docs/docker.en-US.md):
```
docker build -t videolingo .
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --gpus all videolingo
```

## APIs
[](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo#apis)
VideoLingo supports OpenAI-Like API format and various TTS interfaces:
  * LLM: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, `deepseek-chat(v3)`, `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`, `gpt-4o`, ... (sorted by performance)
  * WhisperX: Run whisperX locally or use 302.ai API
  * TTS: `azure-tts`, `openai-tts`, `siliconflow-fishtts`, **`fish-tts`**,`GPT-SoVITS` , `edge-tts`, `*custom-tts`(You can modify your own TTS in custom_tts.py!)


> **Note:** VideoLingo works with **[302.ai](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9)** - one API key for all services (LLM, WhisperX, TTS). Or run locally with Ollama and Edge-TTS for free, no API needed!
For detailed installation, API configuration, and batch mode instructions, please refer to the documentation: [English](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo/blob/main/docs/pages/docs/start.en-US.md) | [中文](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo/blob/main/docs/pages/docs/start.zh-CN.md)
## Current Limitations
[](https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo#current-limitations)
  1. WhisperX transcription performance may be affected by video background noise, as it uses wav2vac model for alignment. For videos with loud background music, please enable Voice Separation Enhancement. Additionally, subtitles ending with numbers or special characters may be truncated early due to wav2vac's inability to map numeric characters (e.g., "1") to their spoken form ("one").
  2. Using weaker models can lead to errors during intermediate processes due to strict JSON format requirements for responses. If this error occurs, please delete the `output` folder and retry with a different LLM, otherwise repeated execution will read the previous erroneous response causing the same error.
  3. The dubbing feature may not be 100% perfect due to differences in speech rates and intonation between languages, as well as the impact of the translation step. However, this project has implemented extensive engineering processing for speech rates to ensure the best possible dubbing results.
  4. **Multilingual video transcription recognition will only retain the main language**. This is because whisperX uses a specialized model for a single language when forcibly aligning word-level subtitles, and will delete unrecognized languages.
  5. **Cannot dub multiple characters separately** , as whisperX's speaker distinction capability is not sufficiently reliable.
