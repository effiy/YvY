### Frequently asked questions
#### How do I sponsor a project?
Sign in and start by navigating to [your dependencies](https://github.com/sponsors/explore), your [explore tab](https://github.com/explore), [trending repositories](https://github.com/explore), or [collections](https://github.com/collections). When a repository has the Sponsor graphic, you can sponsor them directly.
#### How do I get paid for my contributions?
You can become a sponsored developer by joining GitHub Sponsors, completing your sponsored developer profile, creating sponsorship tiers, submitting your bank and tax information, and enabling two-factor authentication for your account on GitHub.com. [Learn more about getting paid for contributions](https://docs.github.com/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account)
#### Do I need to fill out a tax form to receive sponsorships?
Yes. Your tax information must be on file in order for GitHub to make payments to your bank account. The required tax documents may vary based on your location.
Note that we do our best to help you with the Sponsors program, but we’re unable to provide tax guidance.
