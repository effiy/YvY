# AI Shell
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#ai-shell)
## Setup
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#setup)
> The minimum supported version of Node.js is v14
  1. Install _ai shell_ :
```
npm install -g @builder.io/ai-shell
```

  2. Retrieve your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
> Note: If you haven't already, you'll have to create an account and set up billing.
  3. Set the key so ai-shell can use it:
```
ai config set OPENAI_KEY=<your token>
```

This will create a `.ai-shell` file in your home directory.


## Usage
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#usage)
```
ai <prompt>
```

For example:
```
ai list all log files
```

Then you will get an output like this, where you can choose to run the suggested command, revise the command via a prompt, or cancel:
```
◇ Your script:
│
│ find . -name "*.log"
│
◇ Explanation:
│
│ 1. Searches for all files with the extension ".log" in the current directory and any subdirectories.
│
◆ Run this script?
│ ● ✅ Yes (Lets go!)
│ ○ 📝 Revise
│ ○ ❌ Cancel
└
```

### Special characters
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#special-characters)
Note that some shells handle certain characters like the `?` or `*` or things that look like file paths specially. If you are getting strange behaviors, you can wrap the prompt in quotes to avoid issues, like below:
```
ai 'what is my ip address'
```

### Chat mode
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#chat-mode)
[![Chat demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/844291/232889699-e13fb3fe-1659-4583-80ee-6c58d1bcbd06.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/844291/232889699-e13fb3fe-1659-4583-80ee-6c58d1bcbd06.gif)
```
ai chat
```

With this mode, you can engage in a conversation with the AI and receive helpful responses in a natural, conversational manner directly through the CLI:
```
┌ Starting new conversation
│
◇ You:
│ how do I serve a redirect in express
│
◇ AI Shell:
In Express, you can use the `redirect()` method to serve a redirect. The `redirect()` method takes one argument, which is the URL that you want to redirect to.
Here's an example:
\`\`\`js
app.get('/oldurl', (req, res) => {
 res.redirect('/newurl');
});
\`\`\`
```

### Silent mode (skip explanations)
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#silent-mode-skip-explanations)
You can disable and skip the explanation section by using the flag `-s` or `--silent`
```
ai -s list all log files
```

or save the option as a preference using this command:
```
ai config set SILENT_MODE=true
```

### Custom API endpoint
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#custom-api-endpoint)
You can custom OpenAI API endpoint to set OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT（default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`）
```
ai config set OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=<your proxy endpoint>
```

### Set Language
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#set-language)
[![Language UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1784873/235330029-0a3b394c-d797-41d6-8717-9a6b487f1ae8.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1784873/235330029-0a3b394c-d797-41d6-8717-9a6b487f1ae8.gif)
The AI Shell's default language is English, but you can easily switch to your preferred language by using the corresponding language keys, as shown below:
Language | Key  
---|---  
English | en  
Simplified Chinese | zh-Hans  
Traditional Chinese | zh-Hant  
Spanish | es  
Japanese | jp  
Korean | ko  
French | fr  
German | de  
Russian | ru  
Ukrainian | uk  
Vietnamese | vi  
Arabic | ar  
Portuguese | pt  
Turkish | tr  
For instance, if you want to switch to Simplified Chinese, you can do so by setting the LANGUAGE value to zh-Hans:
```
ai config set LANGUAGE=zh-Hans
```

This will set your language to Simplified Chinese.
### Config UI
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#config-ui)
To use a more visual interface to view and set config options you can type:
```
ai config
```

To get an interactive UI like below:
```
◆ Set config:
│ ○ OpenAI Key
│ ○ OpenAI API Endpoint
│ ○ Silent Mode
│ ● Model (gpt-4o-mini)
│ ○ Language
│ ○ Cancel
└
```

### Upgrading
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#upgrading)
Check the installed version with:
```
ai --version
```

If it's not the [latest version](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell/tags), run:
```
npm update -g @builder.io/ai-shell
```

Or just use AI shell:
```
ai update
```

## Common Issues
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#common-issues)
### 429 error
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#429-error)
Some users are reporting a 429 from OpenAI. This is due to incorrect billing setup or excessive quota usage. Please follow [this guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6891831-error-code-429-you-exceeded-your-current-quota-please-check-your-plan-and-billing-details) to fix it.
You can activate billing at [this link](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview). Make sure to add a payment method if not under an active grant from OpenAI.
## Motivation
[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell#motivation)
I am not a bash wizard, and am dying for access to the copilot CLI, and got impatient.
## Contributing
