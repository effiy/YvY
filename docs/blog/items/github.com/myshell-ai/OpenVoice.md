## Introduction
[](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice#introduction)
### OpenVoice V1
[](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice#openvoice-v1)
As we detailed in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01479) and [website](https://research.myshell.ai/open-voice), the advantages of OpenVoice are three-fold:
**1. Accurate Tone Color Cloning.** OpenVoice can accurately clone the reference tone color and generate speech in multiple languages and accents.
**2. Flexible Voice Style Control.** OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, such as emotion and accent, as well as other style parameters including rhythm, pauses, and intonation.
**3. Zero-shot Cross-lingual Voice Cloning.** Neither of the language of the generated speech nor the language of the reference speech needs to be presented in the massive-speaker multi-lingual training dataset.
### OpenVoice V2
[](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice#openvoice-v2)
In April 2024, we released OpenVoice V2, which includes all features in V1 and has:
**1. Better Audio Quality.** OpenVoice V2 adopts a different training strategy that delivers better audio quality.
**2. Native Multi-lingual Support.** English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese and Korean are natively supported in OpenVoice V2.
**3. Free Commercial Use.** Starting from April 2024, both V2 and V1 are released under MIT License. Free for commercial use.

OpenVoice has been powering the instant voice cloning capability of [myshell.ai](https://app.myshell.ai/explore) since May 2023. Until Nov 2023, the voice cloning model has been used tens of millions of times by users worldwide, and witnessed the explosive user growth on the platform.
