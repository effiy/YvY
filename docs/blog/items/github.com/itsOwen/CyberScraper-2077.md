Please follow the Docker Container Guide given below, as I won't be able to maintain another version for Windows systems.
## 🛠 Installation
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#-installation)
**Note: CyberScraper 2077 requires Python 3.10 or higher.**
  1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077.git
cd CyberScraper-2077
```

  2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Optional
```

  3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  4. Install the playwright:
```
playwright install
```

  5. Set OpenAI & Gemini Key in your environment:
Linux/Mac:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

  6. If you want to use Ollama:


Note: I only recommend using OpenAI and Gemini API as these models are really good at following instructions. If you are using open-source LLMs, make sure you have a good system as the speed of the data generation/presentation depends on how well your system can run the LLM. You may also have to fine-tune the prompt and add some additional filters yourself.
```
1. Setup Ollama using `pip install ollama`
2. Download Ollama from the official website: https://ollama.com/download
3. Now type: ollama pull llama3.1 or whatever LLM you want to use.
4. Now follow the rest of the steps below.
```

## 🐳 Docker Installation
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#-docker-installation)
If you prefer to use Docker, follow these steps to set up and run CyberScraper 2077:
  1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
  2. Clone this repository:

  5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.


### Using Ollama with Docker
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#using-ollama-with-docker)
If you want to use Ollama with the Docker setup:
  1. Install Ollama on your host machine following the instructions at <https://ollama.com/download>
  2. Run Ollama on your host machine:
```
ollama pull llama3.1
```

  3. Find your host machine's IP address:
     * On Linux/Mac: `ifconfig` or `ip addr show`
     * On Windows: `ipconfig`
  4. Run the Docker container with the host network and set the Ollama URL:
```
docker run -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 -p 8501:8501 cyberscraper-2077
```

Now visit the url: <http://localhost:8501/>
On Linux you might need to use this below:
```
docker run -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://<your-host-ip>:11434 -p 8501:8501 cyberscraper-2077
```

Replace `<your-host-ip>` with your actual host machine IP address.
  5. In the Streamlit interface, select the Ollama model you want to use (e.g., "ollama:llama3.1").


Note: Ensure that your firewall allows connections to port 11434 for Ollama.
## 🚀 Usage
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#-usage)
  1. Fire up the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

  2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
  3. Enter the URL of the site you want to scrape or ask a question about the data you need.
  4. Ask the chatbot to extract the data in any format. Select whatever data you want to export or even everything from the webpage.
  5. Watch as CyberScraper 2077 tears through the net, extracting your data faster than you can say "flatline"!

[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#-multi-page-scraping-beta)
> **Note** : The multi-page scraping feature is currently in beta. While functional, you may encounter occasional issues or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your feedback and patience as we continue to improve this feature.
CyberScraper 2077 now supports multi-page scraping, allowing you to extract data from multiple pages of a website in one go. This feature is perfect for scraping paginated content, search results, or any site with data spread across multiple pages.
### How to Use Multi-Page Scraping
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#how-to-use-multi-page-scraping)
I suggest you enter the URL structure every time if you want to scrape multiple pages so it can detect the URL structure easily. It detects nearly all URL types.
  1. **Basic Usage** : To scrape multiple pages, use the following format when entering the URL:
```
https://example.com/page 1-5
https://example.com/p/ 1-6
https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1-3

```

This will scrape pages 1 through 5 of the website.
  2. **Custom Page Ranges** : You can specify custom page ranges:
```
https://example.com/p/ 1-5,7,9-12
https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1,7,8,9

```

This will scrape pages 1 to 5, page 7, and pages 9 to 12.
  3. **URL Patterns** : For websites with different URL structures, you can specify a pattern:
```
https://example.com/search?q=cyberpunk&page={page} 1-5

```

Replace `{page}` with where the page number should be in the URL.
  4. **Automatic Pattern Detection** : If you don't specify a pattern, CyberScraper 2077 will attempt to detect the URL pattern automatically. However, for best results, specifying the pattern is recommended.


### Tips for Effective Multi-Page Scraping
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#tips-for-effective-multi-page-scraping)
  * Start with a small range of pages to test before scraping a large number.
  * Be mindful of the website's load and your scraping speed to avoid overloading servers.
  * Use the `simulate_human` option for more natural scraping behavior on sites with anti-bot measures.
  * Regularly check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure compliance.


### Example
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#example)
```
URL Example : "https://news.ycombinator.com/?p=1 1-3 or 1,2,3,4"
```

If you want to scrape a specific page, just enter the query "please scrape page number 1 or 2". If you want to scrape all pages, simply give a query like "scrape all pages in csv" or whatever format you want.
### Handling Errors
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#handling-errors)
If you encounter errors during multi-page scraping:
  * Check your internet connection
  * Verify the URL pattern is correct
  * Ensure the website allows scraping
  * Try reducing the number of pages or increasing the delay between requests


### Beta Feedback
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#beta-feedback)

## 🧅 Tor Network Scraping
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#-tor-network-scraping)
> **Note** : The Tor network scraping feature allows you to access and scrape .onion sites. This feature requires additional setup and should be used responsibly and legally.
CyberScraper 2077 now supports scraping .onion sites through the Tor network, allowing you to access and extract data from the dark web safely and anonymously. This feature is perfect for researchers, security analysts, and investigators who need to gather information from Tor hidden services.
### Prerequisites
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#prerequisites)
  1. Install Tor on your system:
```
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tor
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install tor
# Start the Tor service
sudo service tor start # on Linux
brew services start tor # on macOS
```

  2. Install additional Python packages:
```
pip install PySocks requests[socks]
```



### Using Tor Scraping
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#using-tor-scraping)
  1. **Basic Usage** : Simply enter an .onion URL, and CyberScraper will automatically detect and route it through the Tor network:
```
http://example123abc.onion

```

  2. **Safety Features** :
     * Automatic .onion URL detection
     * Built-in connection verification
     * Tor Browser-like request headers
     * Automatic circuit isolation


### Configuration Options
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#configuration-options)
You can customize the Tor scraping behavior by adjusting the following settings:
```
tor_config = TorConfig(
  socks_port=9050,     # Default Tor SOCKS port
  circuit_timeout=10,    # Timeout for circuit creation
  auto_renew_circuit=True,  # Automatically renew Tor circuit
  verify_connection=True   # Verify Tor connection before scraping
)
```

### Security Considerations
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#security-considerations)
  * Always ensure you're complying with local laws and regulations
  * Use a VPN in addition to Tor for extra security
  * Be patient as Tor connections can be slower than regular web scraping
  * Avoid sending personal or identifying information through Tor
  * Some .onion sites may be offline or unreachable


### Docker Support
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#docker-support)
For Docker users, add these additional flags to enable Tor support:
```
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
 --network="host" \
 -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key" \
 cyberscraper-2077
```

### Troubleshooting
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#troubleshooting)
If you encounter issues with Tor scraping:
  * Verify Tor service is running (`sudo service tor status`)
  * Check SOCKS port availability (`netstat -an | grep 9050`)
  * Ensure proper Tor installation (`tor --version`)
  * Verify internet connectivity
  * Check firewall settings

## Adjusting PlaywrightScraper Settings (optional)
[](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077#adjusting-playwrightscraper-settings-optional)
Customize the `PlaywrightScraper` settings to fit your scraping needs. If some websites are giving you issues, you might want to check the behavior of the website:
```
use_stealth: bool = True,
simulate_human: bool = False,
use_custom_headers: bool = True,
hide_webdriver: bool = True,
bypass_cloudflare: bool = True:
```

Adjust these settings based on your target website and environment for optimal results.
You can also bypass the captcha using the `-captcha` parameter at the end of the URL. The browser window will pop up, complete the captcha, and go back to your terminal window. Press enter and the bot will complete its task.
