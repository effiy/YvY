## Frequently Asked Questions
[](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rightmenu-master#frequently-asked-questions)
### Finder Extension Partial Menu Not Displaying Issue
[](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rightmenu-master#finder-extension-partial-menu-not-displaying-issue)
When permissions are passively confirmed and then denied, reauthorizing permissions may cause the menu to not display. In this case, you need to restart the Finder extension. Restarting the computer can achieve this, but it’s cumbersome. Here are two simpler methods:
  * Method 1: Execute `killall Finder` in the command line to restart Finder.
  * Method 2: Use the system’s `Force Quit Applications` feature to reload Finder. Open the `Force Quit Applications` window using the shortcut `⌘``⌥``esc`, find the `Finder` application, and click the `Relaunch` button below.


### Frequent Authorization Prompts
[](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rightmenu-master#frequent-authorization-prompts)
In the app settings, under `Folder Authorization` -> `Add Folder`, try adding the root directory to avoid frequent authorization prompts.
### Reauthorization After Restart
[](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rightmenu-master#reauthorization-after-restart)
Here is Apple's security policy for Finder extensions. Initially, I thought granting `Full Disk Access` would solve the problem, but I found that it doesn't work. Even with `Full Disk Access` enabled, we still need to manually select the directory and grant permissions in Finder. This process is very cumbersome for personal use, and since App Store submission requires compliance with sandbox security policies, I have not yet found a better solution.
### Enable Finder Extension
[](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rightmenu-master#enable-finder-extension)
If you are prompted to enable the plugin, you can run the following command in the terminal to enable the Finder extension. This issue is caused by a bug in macOS 15+ where the settings interface disappeared. It has been [fixed](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/756711?answerId=812519022#812519022) in macOS 15.2.
```
