# 深入高可用系统原理与设计
[](https://github.com/isno/theByteBook#深入高可用系统原理与设计)
## 这是什么？
[](https://github.com/isno/theByteBook#这是什么)
这是一本关于架构设计的开源书籍，已经完稿。如果阅读文章发现问题，欢迎在 github 给我提交 PR 或者 issue。
以下为我的公众号，欢迎与我讨论技术。

## ⭐️ 为什么要写这个？
[](https://github.com/isno/theByteBook#️-为什么要写这个)
这几年互联网基础设施技术出现了很大的更新迭代，比如容器技术（Container、Kubernetes）、服务网格（ServiceMesh）、无服务器（Serverless）、高性能网络（DPDK、XDP、RDMA）等等，我对这些技术有一些浅薄的见解和实践，但远没达到深刻理解的境界，我尝试使用 `费曼学习法` 把这些东西体系化地总结输出。一方面加深自我的学习认知，另一方面也希望这些输出对其他人有所帮助。
整个系列的内容主要集中在 `网络`、`集群以及服务治理`、`FinOps` 这三个主题，这也代表着基础架构的几个核心：稳定、效率、成本。
我会持续更新这个仓库的内容，如果想要关注可以点 `star` 。
