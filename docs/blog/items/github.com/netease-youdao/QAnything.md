### Why 2 stage retrieval?
[](https://github.com/netease-youdao/QAnything#why-2-stage-retrieval)
In scenarios with a large volume of knowledge base data, the advantages of a two-stage approach are very clear. If only a first-stage embedding retrieval is used, there will be a problem of retrieval degradation as the data volume increases, as indicated by the green line in the following graph. However, after the second-stage reranking, there can be a stable increase in accuracy, **the more data, the better the performance**.

## Comparison of New and Old Parsing Effects
[](https://github.com/netease-youdao/QAnything#comparison-of-new-and-old-parsing-effects)
  * First, with regard to the parsing of large tables in documents, especially tables that span multiple pages, version 2.0 has made significant improvements. The new version's parsing logic can analyze the structure of the table, including the layout of rows and columns, and can automatically identify the table headers, placing them at the top of each table segment that is split. This improvement prevents interruptions in meaning caused by logical segmentation when parsing long tables.

  * In addition, version 2.0 has also been optimized for handling text columnation and cross-page layout. It can recognize double-column or multi-column layouts of text and correctly divide text blocks in accordance with human reading habits. At the same time, this version can also save images in documents to ensure the integrity of content is not lost during file parsing. As shown in the figure below, the correct arrangement should be to group the text arranged in sequence as 1, 2, 3 into a large paragraph and then segment it, rather than segmenting 1, 2, 3 separately. 
    * In version 1.4 parsing results, the cross-page text "higher" was chunked into the next text block, which is detrimental to large model semantic understanding. In version 2.0 parsing results, it is correctly divided, and images interspersed in text paragraphs are also parsed into corresponding chunk statements. Non-main text such as "Figure 1 Identification and Authorization and Their Support Relationship 37" and "Cover Story Cover Feature" were successfully filtered out.

  * Version 2.0 has also made corresponding optimizations for parsing tables interspersed between text columns or text blocks. The parsing of the original version could not recognize tables and would only parse them in the format of text paragraphs. This not only destroys the logical structure of the tables but also adds a section of messy and useless text for large models, which would affect the accuracy of large model responses. Version 2.0 can recognize and parse these tables embedded in the text, thereby improving the quality of parsing and the accuracy of responses from large models. 
    * In version 1.4 parsing results, tables interspersed in text blocks are parsed as normal text blocks. In version 2.0, this type of table can be parsed "elegantly", which not only improves the quality of parsing but also increases the accuracy of large model answers.
    * In addition, in version 2.0, when processing text under specific subheadings, priority is given to ensuring that these texts are segmented into the same chunk block to maintain logical coherence. When the text is too long and needs to be split, the parsing logic of version 2.0 will repeat the same subheading before each split text block to indicate ownership. For example, in the example, the same subheading "European Conference: Legal Status of Robots" was added to all three text blocks (due to the length of the text, this title was not displayed in the original file screenshot). This processing method effectively avoids the problem of incoherent semantic logic in split text blocks caused by excessively long text.

  * For Excel (.xlsx) documents with complex formatting, version 2.0 has undergone a series of optimization measures to accurately identify and process row and column data, including optimized handling of merged cells and text spanning across rows or columns. Specific examples can be seen below. 
    * In version 1.4, there may be some limitations when parsing Excel documents, especially for documents with special structures or formats. The parsing results may not be satisfactory, mainly recognizing only the plain text part. This may lead to information loss or format disorder when dealing with complex data and formats. In contrast, version 2.0 has significantly improved parsing capabilities, able to better handle various complex formats of Excel documents. Although it may not be perfect yet, it can already solve the vast majority of complex situations.

  * Similarly, for simple formatted xlsx documents, version 2.0 of the parser has been optimized.

  * In the latest version, we have also made significant improvements to the URL parsing function. Taking the following page as an example, the old version may miss a large amount of page information during the parsing process and cannot effectively handle more complex page elements such as tables and lists. However, the new version has been optimized for these issues and can parse these contents more accurately.

  * In addition, for the vast majority of files, version 2.0 has also made corresponding optimizations, including but not limited to the following points. 
    * Improved the cutting logic of chunk blocks, avoiding semantic blocks being too short or logic interruption due to blank lines or paragraphs in the document, ensuring the coherence and integrity of text blocks.
    * The new version can more accurately identify the subheadings in the document, and locate and organize the corresponding text blocks based on these subheadings, which helps optimize the parsing effect, making the parsing structure clearer and the information hierarchy more distinct.
    * The comparison of the analysis results is as follows: In version 1.4, the parsing logic divides the document into 10 chunks, while in version 2.0, after parsing, there are only 4 chunks. The more reasonable and fewer chunk blocks greatly improve the coherence and integrity of the content, helping to reduce semantic breaks or logical confusion caused by improper segmentation, thereby improving the overall parsing and model answering effects.

### In summary, version 2.0 parsing has optimized many aspects compared to version 1.4 parsing, including but not limited to
[](https://github.com/netease-youdao/QAnything#in-summary-version-20-parsing-has-optimized-many-aspects-compared-to-version-14-parsing-including-but-not-limited-to)
  1. By using more reasonable chunk lengths, the semantic and logical losses caused by paragraphs being too small or incomplete are reduced.
  2. Improved recognition ability for columned text, able to intelligently determine reading order, even correctly handling paragraphs that span across pages.
  3. The new version can recognize and save images and tables within text paragraphs, ensuring that no important text information is missed.
  4. Optimized table parsing, including parsing and storage of long tables exceeding chunk limits and complex structured xlsx files.
  5. Based on the identified subheadings in the document, locate and organize corresponding text blocks to make the parsing structure clearer and the information hierarchy more distinct.
  6. Optimized parsing results for webpage URLs, converted to .md format.
  7. Support for more encoding formats of txt files and docx files.
