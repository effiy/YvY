## Prerequisites (Optional if only using Email or Webhook notifications)
[](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me#prerequisites-optional-if-only-using-email-or-webhook-notifications)
  1. **Bark Server Setup** : Set up your Bark server by following the instructions provided in the [Bark Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/Finb/bark-server/blob/master/README.md).
  2. You can also use the [Bark public server](https://bark.day.app/) if you don't want to set up your own. However, it is not recommended considering privacy.


## Installation Instructions
[](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me#installation-instructions)
  1. **Download the App**
     * Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me/releases) section of this repository.
     * Download the latest version of the APK.
  2. **Install the App**
     * Transfer the APK file to your Android device.
     * Install the APK by opening the file and following the on-screen prompts.
  3. **App Permissions**
     * After installation, make sure to grant the following permissions: 
       * **SMS** : To capture incoming SMS messages.
       * **Phone Calls** : To capture incoming call details.
       * **Autostart** : Enable the app to start automatically when the phone reboots.


## Setup Instructions
[](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me#setup-instructions)
  1. **Configure Bark Server URL**
     * Open the app and configure the Bark server URL to forward incoming messages.
     * You can obtain the base URL from your Bark server setup (e.g., `http://your-bark-server-url/...`).
  2. **Configure Email Notification**
     * Open the app and navigate to the email configuration section.
     * Provide the recipient email address where notifications should be sent.
     * Enable the **useSSL** option if your email server requires a secure connection.
  3. **Configure Webhook**
     * Open the app and navigate to the webhook configuration section.
     * Provide the **Webhook Endpoint URL** where incoming call and SMS information should be forwarded.
     * Optionally, you can add **Webhook Headers** (e.g., authentication tokens) to include in the HTTP request.
     * You can also specify the Webhook body template. Default is `{"type": "<TYPE>", "sender":"<SENDER>", "message":"<MESSAGE>", "timestamp":"<TIMESTAMP>"}`.
  4. **Configure HTTP**
     * Open the app and navigate to the HTTP configuration section.
     * Provide the **HTTP Endpoint URL** where incoming call and SMS information should be forwarded.
     * Optionally, you can add **HTTP Headers** (e.g., authentication tokens) to include in the HTTP request.
     * You can also specify the HTTP body template. Default is `{"type": "<TYPE>", "sender":"<SENDER>", "message":"<MESSAGE>", "timestamp":"<TIMESTAMP>"}`.


## Usage
[](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me#usage)
  * Once installed and configured, the app will run in the background.
  * It will capture incoming calls and SMS messages and automatically forward them to the configured Bark server, via email, or through the webhook or HTTP endpoint.
  * Notifications will be sent to devices that have the Bark app installed, to the configured email address, or to the webhook server.


## Notes
[](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me#notes)
  * Ensure the app is not restricted by battery optimization settings to allow continuous background operation.
  * Make sure that the Bark server or webhook endpoint is set up and running properly to receive notifications.
  * Ensure correct email and webhook configurations for notifications to be successfully sent.


## Troubleshooting
[](https://github.com/jinweijie/notify-me#troubleshooting)
  * If the app stops forwarding messages, ensure it has all necessary permissions and is allowed to run in the background.
  * Check the Bark server or webhook setup to ensure it's correctly configured to accept forwarded messages.
  * Verify that the email configuration is correct and that the app can access the internet to send emails.
