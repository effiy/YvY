## 🚀 Quick Start
[](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent#-quick-start)
We offer two modes for using WebDesignAgent: terminal-based and GUI-based. We recommend trying the GUI mode for its user-friendly interface and greater control.
### 1. Run in GUI
[](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent#1-run-in-gui)
```
python gui.py
```

Then you will enter the GUI as follows: [![gui](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent/raw/main/assets/gui.png)](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent/blob/main/assets/gui.png)
#### Auto Generation
[](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent#auto-generation)
For a quick usage of our WebDesignAgent, please follow these steps:
  1. Config `Select Mode` to `Web Design Mode`.
  2. Config `Select Model` according to your APIs. In our demos, we primarily use `gpt-4o`.
  3. Select the website language in the `Language` field.
  4. Config `CSS Framework` to your favored style, e.g. `Tailwind`.
  5. Set `save_file`, which saves your generated websites. . **Enter your request in either the`website_description` field for textual requests, the `website_template_path` field for image template requests, or both for a combined input.**
  6. If you want to build your website with your local images, please indicate the image storage path `local_img_storage_path` for our agent to load and then click `load`.
  7. Click the `Plan` button, which will return the textual descriptions of planned websites, their contents, and their relations. You can also change these descriptions if you find them unsuitable.
  8. Click `Auto Generate` to generate all the above websites for you. The screenshot of your created websites will show on the right part of the GUI tool. (It may take some time for the entire website generation)
  9. Set Vision to `Close` can reduce the cost but will decrease the quaility.


#### Human Feedback
[](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent#human-feedback)
If you want to generate a website with more human control. Following steps 1-7 in **Auto Generation** to get the automatically generated plans. Then customize your websites with the following ways:
  * You can modify the plan results by directly typing your own thoughts.
  * You can also add/delete the unsatisfied web pages.
  * You can also provide some feedback in the `feedback` field to globally control the created websites.


### 2. Run in terminal
[](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent#2-run-in-terminal)
```
python webdesign.py --save_file "saves/shopping/" --text "a shopping website" --refine_times 2
```

## 📑 TODO lists
[](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent#-todo-lists)
  1. Support more LLMs.
  2. Support local code modification.
  3. Generate supporting backend code.
  4. At present, this is still a relatively rough demo, and we really hope that you can provide feedback to help us improve it. We welcome you to raise issues to point out our shortcomings.
