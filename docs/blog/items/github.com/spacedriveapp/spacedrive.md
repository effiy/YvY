Important
We regret to inform our valued Spacedrive community that we must temporarily pause our development roadmap beyond our [latest update](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/releases/tag/0.4.3). Due to current funding constraints and related challenges, we cannot deliver new features or updates for the foreseeable future.
While this was a tough decision, our team remains committed to Spacedrive's vision and will explore options to resume development when circumstances allow. We deeply appreciate your understanding and continued support during this challenging period.
The Spacedrive Team

# What is a VDFS?
[](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive#what-is-a-vdfs)
A VDFS (virtual distributed filesystem) is a filesystem designed to work across a variety of storage layers. With a uniform API to manipulate and access content across many devices, VDFS is not restricted to a single machine. It achieves this by maintaining a virtual index of all storage locations, synchronizing the database between clients in realtime. This implementation also uses [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) (Content-addressable storage) to uniquely identify files, while keeping record of logical file paths relative to the storage locations.
The first implementation of a VDFS can be found in this UC Berkeley [paper](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2018/EECS-2018-29.pdf) by Haoyuan Li. This paper describes its use for cloud computing, however the underlying concepts can be translated to open consumer software.
# Motivation
[](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive#motivation)
Many of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren’t backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.

# Architecture
[](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive#architecture)
This project is using what I'm calling the **"PRRTT"** stack (Prisma, Rust, React, TypeScript, Tauri).
  * Prisma on the front-end? 🤯 Made possible thanks to [prisma-client-rust](https://github.com/brendonovich/prisma-client-rust), developed by [Brendonovich](https://github.com/brendonovich). Gives us access to the powerful migration CLI in development, along with the Prisma syntax for our schema. The application bundles with the Prisma query engine and codegen for a beautiful Rust API. Our lightweight migration runner is custom built for a desktop app context.
  * Tauri allows us to create a pure Rust native OS webview, without the overhead of your average Electron app. This brings the bundle size and average memory usage down dramatically. It also contributes to a more native feel, especially on macOS due to Safari's close integration with the OS.
  * We also use [rspc](https://rspc.dev), created by Oscar Beaumont, which allows us to define functions in Rust and call them on the TypeScript frontend in a completely typesafe manner.
  * The core (`sdcore`) is written in pure Rust.
