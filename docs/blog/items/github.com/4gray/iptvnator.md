## How to Build and Develop
[](https://github.com/4gray/iptvnator#how-to-build-and-develop)
Requirements:

  * Rust (required for tauri)


  1. Clone this repository and install project dependencies:
```
$ npm install

```

  2. Start the application:
```
$ npm run tauri dev

```



This will open the Tauri version in a separate window, while the PWA version will be available at <http://localhost:4200>.
