cobalt is sponsored by [royalehosting.net](https://royalehosting.net/?partner=cobalt). a part of our infrastructure is hosted on their network. we really appreciate their kindness and support!
### ethics
[](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt#ethics)
cobalt is a tool that makes downloading public content easier. it takes **zero liability**. the end user is responsible for what they download, how they use and distribute that content. cobalt never caches any content, it [works like a fancy proxy](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/main/api/src/stream).
cobalt is in no way a piracy tool and cannot be used as such. it can only download free & publicly accessible content. same content can be downloaded via dev tools of any modern web browser.
