## Usage
[](https://github.com/ozgrozer/ai-renamer#usage)
You need to have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and at least one LLM (Llava, Gemma, Llama etc.) installed on your system. You need to have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to rename videos.
Run with NPX
```
npx ai-renamer /path
```

Run with NPM
```
# Install it globally
npm install -g ai-renamer
# Run it
ai-renamer /path
```

## Ollama Usage
[](https://github.com/ozgrozer/ai-renamer#ollama-usage)
Ollama is the default provider so you don't have to do anything. You can just run `npx ai-renamer /images`. At the first launch it will try to auto-select the Llava model but if it couldn't do that you can specify the model.
```
npx ai-renamer /path --provider=ollama --model=llava:13b
```

## LM Studio Usage
[](https://github.com/ozgrozer/ai-renamer#lm-studio-usage)
You need to set the provider as `lm-studio` and it will auto-select the loaded model in LM Studio.
```
npx ai-renamer /path --provider=lm-studio
```

## OpenAI Usage
[](https://github.com/ozgrozer/ai-renamer#openai-usage)
You need to set the provider as `openai` and the api-key with your API key and it will auto-select the gpt-4o model. But you can assign any model with `--model` flag.
```
npx ai-renamer /path --provider=openai --api-key=OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Custom Ports
[](https://github.com/ozgrozer/ai-renamer#custom-ports)
If you're using a different port in Ollama or LM Studio you could simply specify the base URLs.
```
npx ai-renamer /path --provider=ollama --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:11434
npx ai-renamer /path --provider=lm-studio --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:1234
```

## Params
[](https://github.com/ozgrozer/ai-renamer#params)
The values of the flags will be saved to your disk when you use them. You can find the config file at `~/ai-renamer.json`. If you're using a Mac it's `/Users/your-user-name/ai-renamer.json`. Also when you set a flag you don't have to use them again. The script gets the values from this config file.
```
npx ai-renamer --help
Options:
 -h, --help          Show help               [boolean]
   --version         Show version number          [boolean]
 -p, --provider        Set the provider (e.g. ollama, openai,
                lm-studio)               [string]
 -a, --api-key         Set the API key if you're using openai as
                provider                [string]
 -u, --base-url        Set the API base URL (e.g.
                http://127.0.0.1:11434 for ollama)   [string]
 -m, --model          Set the model to use (e.g. gemma2, llama3,
                gpt-4o)                 [string]
 -f, --frames         Set the maximum number of frames to extract from
                videos (e.g. 3, 5, 10)         [number]
 -c, --case          Set the case style (e.g. camelCase, pascalCase,
                snakeCase, kebabCase)          [string]
 -x, --chars          Set the maximum number of characters in the new
                filename (e.g. 25)           [number]
 -l, --language        Set the output language (e.g. English, Turkish)
                                    [string]
 -s, --include-subdirectories Include files in subdirectories when processing
                (e.g: true, false)           [string]
 -r, --custom-prompt      Add a custom prompt to the LLM (e.g. "Only
                describe the background")        [string]
```

`ai-renamer` uses `change-case` library for case styling
```
# value: result
camelCase: twoWords
capitalCase: Two Words
constantCase: TWO_WORDS
dotCase: two.words
kebabCase: two-words
noCase: two words
pascalCase: TwoWords
pascalSnakeCase: Two_Words
pathCase: two/words
sentenceCase: Two words
snakeCase: two_words
trainCase: Two-Words
```
