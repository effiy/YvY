# PPTX2MD
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#pptx2md)
[![Downloads](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87b7c5c8d0e1ed2393ad098ad0e9902fbc4437d0856a54d472fb3cc2f9f05b5d/68747470733a2f2f706570792e746563682f62616467652f70707478326d64)](https://pepy.tech/project/pptx2md)

## Installation & Usage
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#installation--usage)
### Installation
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#installation)
You need to have _[Python](https://www.python.org/)_ with version later than **3.10** and _pip_ installed on your system, then run in the terminal:
```
pip install pptx2md
```

### Usage
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#usage)
Once you have installed it, use the command `pptx2md [pptx filename]` to convert _pptx file_ into markdown.
The default output filename is `out.md`, and any pictures extracted (and inserted into .md) will be placed in `/img/` folder.
**Note:** older .ppt files are not supported, convert them to the new .pptx version first.
**Upgrade & Remove:**
```
pip install --upgrade pptx2md
pip uninstall pptx2md
```

## Custom Titles
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#custom-titles)
By default, this tool parse all the pptx titles into `level 1` markdown titles, in order to get a hierarchical table of contents, provide your predefined title list in a file and provide it with `-t` argument.
This is a sample title file (titles.txt):
```
Heading 1
 Heading 1.1
  Heading 1.1.1
 Heading 1.2
 Heading 1.3
Heading 2
 Heading 2.1
 Heading 2.2
  Heading 2.1.1
  Heading 2.1.2
 Heading 2.3
Heading 3

```

The first line with spaces in the begining is considered a second level heading and the number of spaces is the unit of indents. In this case, ` Heading 1.1` will be outputted as `## Heading 1.1` . As it has two spaces at the begining, 2 is the unit of heading indent, so `  Heading 1.1.1` with 4 spaces will be outputted as `### Heading 1.1.1`. Header texts are matched with fuzzy matching, unmatched pptx titles will be regarded as the deepest header.
Use it with `pptx2md [filename] -t titles.txt`.
## Full Arguments
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#full-arguments)
  * `-t [filename]` provide the title file
  * `-o [filename]` path of the output file
  * `-i [path]` directory of the extracted pictures
  * `--image-width [width]` the maximum width of the pictures, in px. **If set, images are put as html img tag.**
  * `--disable-image` disable the image extraction
  * `--disable-escaping` do not attempt to escape special characters
  * `--disable-notes` do not add presenter notes
  * `--disable-wmf` keep wmf formatted image untouched (avoid exceptions under linux)
  * `--disable-color` disable color tags in HTML
  * `--enable-slides` deliniate slides `\n---\n`, this can help if you want to convert pptx slides to markdown slides
  * `--try-multi-column` try to detect multi-column slides (very slow)
  * `--min-block-size [size]` the minimum number of characters for a text block to be outputted
  * `--wiki` / `--mdk` if you happen to be using tiddlywiki or madoko, this argument outputs the corresponding markup language
  * `--qmd` outputs to the qmd markup language used for [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) powered presentations
  * `--page [number]` only convert the specified page
  * `--keep-similar-titles` keep similar titles and add "(cont.)" to repeated slide titles


Note: install [wand](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.12/) for better chance of successfully converting wmf images, if needed.

## API Usage
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#api-usage)
You can also use pptx2md programmatically in your Python code:
```
from pptx2md import convert, ConversionConfig
from pathlib import Path
# Basic usage
convert(
  ConversionConfig(
    pptx_path=Path('presentation.pptx'),
    output_path=Path('output.md'),
    image_dir=Path('img'),
    disable_notes=True
  )
)
```

The `ConversionConfig` class accepts the same parameters as the command line arguments:
  * `pptx_path`: Path to the input PPTX file (required)
  * `output_path`: Path for the output markdown file (required)
  * `image_dir`: Directory for extracted images (required)
  * `title_path`: Path to custom titles file
  * `image_width`: Maximum width for images in px
  * `disable_image`: Skip image extraction
  * `disable_escaping`: Skip escaping special characters
  * `disable_notes`: Skip presenter notes
  * `disable_wmf`: Skip WMF image conversion
  * `disable_color`: Skip color tags in HTML
  * `enable_slides`: Add slide delimiters
  * `try_multi_column`: Attempt to detect multi-column slides
  * `min_block_size`: Minimum text block size
  * `wiki`: Output in TiddlyWiki format
  * `mdk`: Output in Madoko format
  * `qmd`: Output in Quarto format
  * `page`: Convert only specified page number
  * `keep_similar_titles`: Keep similar titles with "(cont.)" suffix


## Detailed Parse Rules
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#detailed-parse-rules)
### Text and Layout Processing
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#text-and-layout-processing)
  * Text blocks are identified in two ways: 
    * Paragraphs marked as "body" placeholders in the slide
    * Text shapes containing more than the minimum block size (configurable)
  * Lists are generated when paragraphs in a block have different indentation levels
  * Single-level paragraphs are output as regular text blocks
  * Multi-column layouts can be detected with `--try-multi-column` flag
  * Grouped shapes are recursively flattened to process their contents
  * Shapes are processed in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order


### Title Handling
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#title-handling)
  * When using custom titles: 
    * Fuzzy matching is used to match slide titles with the provided title list
    * Matching score must be > 92 for a match to be accepted
    * Unmatched titles default to the deepest header level
  * Similar titles (matching score > 92) are omitted by default unless `--keep-similar-titles` is used


### Formatting and Styling
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#formatting-and-styling)
  * Text formatting is preserved through markdown syntax: 
    * Bold text from PPT is converted to `**bold**`
    * Italic text is converted to `_italic_`
    * Hyperlinks are preserved as `[text](url)`
  * Color handling: 
    * Theme colors marked as "Accent 1-6" are preserved
    * RGB colors are converted to HTML color codes
    * Dark theme colors are converted to bold text
    * Color tags can be disabled with `--disable-color`


### Special Elements
[](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md#special-elements)
  * Images: 
    * Extracted to specified image directory
    * WMF images are converted to PNG when possible
    * Image width can be constrained with `--image-width`
    * HTML img tags are used when width is specified
  * Tables: 
    * Merged cells are supported
    * Complex formatting within cells is preserved
  * Special characters are escaped by default (can be disabled with `--disable-escaping`)
  * Presenter notes are included unless disabled with `--disable-notes`
