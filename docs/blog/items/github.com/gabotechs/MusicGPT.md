#  MusicGPT [![Signway logo](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT/raw/main/assets/music-icon.svg)](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT/blob/main/assets/music-icon.svg)
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#-----musicgpt----)
Generate music based on natural language prompts using LLMs running locally. 
MusicGPT.demo.mp4
☝️ Turn up the volume! 
# Overview
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#overview)
MusicGPT is an application that allows running the latest music generation AI models locally in a performant way, in any platform and without installing heavy dependencies like Python or machine learning frameworks.
Right now it only supports [MusicGen by Meta](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html), but the plan is to support different music generation models transparently to the user.
The main milestones for the project are:
  * Text conditioned music generation
  * Melody conditioned music generation
  * Indeterminately long / infinite music streams


# Install
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#install)
### Mac and Linux
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#mac-and-linux)
MusicGPT can be installed on Mac and Linux using `brew`:
```
brew install gabotechs/taps/musicgpt
```

### Windows
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#windows)
Download and install MusicGPT's executable file [following this link](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT/releases/latest/download/musicgpt-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe).
### All platforms
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#all-platforms)
Precompiled binaries are available for the following platforms:
  * [macOS Apple Silicon](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT/releases/latest/download/musicgpt-aarch64-apple-darwin)
  * [Linux x86_64](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT/releases/latest/download/musicgpt-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
  * [Windows](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT/releases/latest/download/musicgpt-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe)


Just downloading them and executing them should be enough.
### Docker (Recommend for running with CUDA)
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#docker-recommend-for-running-with-cuda)
If you want to run MusicGPT with a CUDA enabled GPU, this is the best way, as you only need to have [the basic NVIDIA drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed in your system.
```
docker pull gabotechs/musicgpt
```

Once the image is downloaded, you can run it with:
```
docker run -it --gpus all -p 8642:8642 -v ~/.musicgpt:/root/.local/share/musicgpt gabotechs/musicgpt --gpu --ui-expose
```

### With cargo
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#with-cargo)
If you have the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed in your system, you can install it with `cargo`.
```
cargo install musicgpt
```

# Usage
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#usage)
There are two ways of interacting with MusicGPT: the UI mode and the CLI mode.
## UI mode
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#ui-mode)
This mode will display a chat-like web application for exchanging prompts with the LLM. It will:
  * store your chat history
  * allow you to play the generated music samples whenever you want
  * generate music samples in the background
  * allow you to use the UI in a device different from the one executing the LLMs


You can run the UI by just executing the following command:
```
musicgpt
```

You can also choose different models for running inference, and whether to use a GPU or not, for example:
```
musicgpt --gpu --model medium
```

Warning
Most models require really powerful hardware for running inference
If you want to use a CUDA enabled GPU, it's recommended that you run MusicGPT with Docker:
```
docker run -it --gpus all -p 8642:8642 -v ~/.musicgpt:/root/.local/share/musicgpt gabotechs/musicgpt --ui-expose --gpu
```

## CLI mode
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#cli-mode)
This mode will generate and play music directly in the terminal, allowing you to provide multiple prompts and playing audio as soon as it's generated. You can generate audio based on a prompt with the following command:
```
musicgpt "Create a relaxing LoFi song"
```

By default, it produces a sample of 10s, which can be configured up to 30s:
```
musicgpt "Create a relaxing LoFi song" --secs 30
```

There's multiple models available, it will use the smallest one by default, but you can opt into a bigger model:
```
musicgpt "Create a relaxing LoFi song" --model medium
```

Warning
Most models require really powerful hardware for running inference
If you want to use a CUDA enabled GPU, it's recommended that you run MusicGPT with Docker:
```
docker run -it --gpus all -v ~/.musicgpt:/root/.local/share/musicgpt gabotechs/musicgpt --gpu "Create a relaxing LoFi song"
```

You can review all the options available running:
```
musicgpt --help
```

# Benchmarks
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#benchmarks)
The following graph shows the inference time taken for generating 10 seconds of audio using different models on a Mac M1 Pro. For comparison, it's Python equivalent using <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers> is shown.
The command used for generating the 10 seconds of audio was:
```
musicgpt '80s pop track with bassy drums and synth'
```

This is the Python script used for generating the 10 seconds of audio
```
import scipy
import time
from transformers import AutoProcessor, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
inputs = processor(
  text=["80s pop track with bassy drums and synth"],
  padding=True,
  return_tensors="pt",
)
start = time.time()
audio_values = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)
print(time.time() - start) # Log time taken in generation
sampling_rate = model.config.audio_encoder.sampling_rate
scipy.io.wavfile.write("musicgen_out.wav", rate=sampling_rate, data=audio_values[0, 0].numpy())
```

# Storage
[](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT#storage)
MusicGPT needs access to your storage in order to save downloaded models and generated audios along with some metadata needed for the application to work properly. Assuming your username is `foo`, it will store the data in the following locations:
  * Windows: `C:\Users\foo\AppData\Roaming\gabotechs\musicgpt`
  * MacOS: `/Users/foo/Library/Application\ Support/com.gabotechs.musicgpt`
  * Linux: `/home/foo/.config/musicgpt`
