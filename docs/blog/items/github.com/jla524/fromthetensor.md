## From the Tensor to Stable Diffusion
[](https://github.com/jla524/fromthetensor#from-the-tensor-to-stable-diffusion)
Inspired by [From the Transistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor).
Machine learning is hard, a lot of tutorials are hard to follow, and it's hard to understand [software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) from first principles.
> You wanna be an ML engineer? Well, here's the steps to get good at that:
>   1. Download a paper
>   2. Implement it
>   3. Keep doing this until you have skills
