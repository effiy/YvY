# how to dev
[](https://github.com/SteveSuv/remix-words-funny#how-to-dev)
  1. clone this repository


```
git clone git@github.com:SteveSuv/remix-words-funny.git

```

  1. install packages


```
npm i pnpm -g
pnpm i

```

  1. init database


  * install [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and start docker service
  * first run command below to create a local postgres container (you can replace the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_EXAMPLE`):


```
docker run -d --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=POSTGRES_PASSWORD_EXAMPLE -e POSTGRES_DB=wordsfunny postgres:16-alpine
```

  * run command `pnpm db:push` to sync db structs and drizzle schema
  * download csv data file: <https://mypikpak.com/s/VOEs95bTB0KGAg75t0Nrs-oOo1>
  * use your favorite db tool like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) to connect the postgres db
  * insert db data by import csv files to tables. Notice! you should first import `Book`, then `Word`, then others, because tables have some relations
  * run `pnpm db:task`, if print `total words count: 152543` means the postgres db is running ok


  1. init email server (optional, if you don't want to send login verify code)


  * when you dev local, you can just print the verify code simply
  * when you deploy to prod, you can use some email server saas like [resend](https://resend.com/)
  * or you can enable some email server's SMTP, then add `EMAIL_SERVER_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_SERVER_PASS` to .env file, like [Netease Email](https://mail.163.com/) or [QQ Email](https://mail.qq.com/)


  1. run dev server


```
pnpm dev

```

  1. build and preview


```
pnpm build
pnpm start

```

# how to deploy
[](https://github.com/SteveSuv/remix-words-funny#how-to-deploy)
  * deploy by docker


```
pnpm run deploy

```

  * deploy by pm2


```
# push files to server
rsync -avz build node_modules package.json .env root@HOST:~/remix-words-funny/
# ssh server and run app
ssh root@HOST "cd ~/remix-words-funny && pm2 start npm -- start"

```

# notice
[](https://github.com/SteveSuv/remix-words-funny#notice)
  * suggest node version greater than 22
  * when you dev local, you should run `docker stop wordsfunny-app` first to stop container to avoid port 3001 occupation
  * words resource [repo](https://github.com/kajweb/dict)
  * more features will be added gradually
  * a more simple `remix-t3-stack` project for beginners is here: [remix-t3-stack](https://github.com/SteveSuv/remix-t3-stack)
