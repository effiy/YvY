## üåÉ Features
[](https://github.com/KRTirtho/spotube#-features)
  * üö´ No ads, thanks to the use of public & free Spotify and YT Music APIs¬π
  * ‚¨áÔ∏è Freely downloadable tracks
  * üñ•Ô∏è üì± Cross-platform support
  * ü™∂ Small size & less data usage
  * üïµÔ∏è Anonymous/guest login
  * üïí Time synced lyrics
  * ‚úã No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
  * üöÄ Native performance
  * üìñ Open source/libre software
  * üîâ Playback control is done locally, not on the server


**¬π** It is still **recommended** to support creators by engaging with their YouTube channels/Spotify tracks (or preferably by buying their merch/concert tickets/physical media).
### ‚ùå Unsupported features
[](https://github.com/KRTirtho/spotube#-unsupported-features)
  * üó£Ô∏è **Spotify Shows & Podcasts:** Shows and Podcasts will **never be supported** because the audio tracks are _only_ available on Spotify and accessing them would require Spotify Premium.
  * üéß **Spotify Listen Along:** [Coming soon!](https://github.com/KRTirtho/spotube/issues/8)
