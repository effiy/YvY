# Livestory
[](https://github.com/zeke/livestory#livestory)
Tell a story and get a live feed of images.
## Setup
[](https://github.com/zeke/livestory#setup)
```
git clone https://github.com/zeke/livestory
cd livestory
script/bootstrap

```

## Usage
[](https://github.com/zeke/livestory#usage)
  1. Run `npm start`
  2. Start talking
  3. output directory fills up with images


## What tools are used?
[](https://github.com/zeke/livestory#what-tools-are-used)
  * WhisperCPP
  * SDXL Turbo on Coreweave
  * LCM (different versions) on Replicate


## Learnin's
[](https://github.com/zeke/livestory#learnins)
  * Whisper CPP is easy to get running locally, and it's pretty fast.
  * Whisper CPP shell output is kinda hard to deal with. It retroactively autocorrects.
  * LCM default styles are leaning towards NSFW
  * Running models on a Coreweave instance is directly faster than Replicate (for now)
