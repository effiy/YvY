# Learn Rust, one exercise at a time
[](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust#learn-rust-one-exercise-at-a-time)
You've heard about Rust, but you never had the chance to try it out? This course is for you!
You'll learn Rust by solving 100 exercises. You'll go from knowing nothing about Rust to being able to start writing your own programs, one exercise at a time.
Note
This course has been written by [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/). It's one of the trainings in [our portfolio of Rust workshops](https://mainmatter.com/services/workshops/rust/). Check out our [landing page](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/) if you're looking for Rust consulting or training!
## Getting started
[](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust#getting-started)
Go to [rust-exercises.com](https://rust-exercises.com) and follow the instructions there to get started with the course.
## Requirements
[](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust#requirements)
  * **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)). If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how you installed Rust on your system) to make sure you're running on the latest stable version.
  * _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support. We recommend one of the following: 
    * [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.


## Solutions
[](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust#solutions)
You can find the solutions to the exercises in the [`solutions` branch](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust/tree/solutions) of this repository.
