## Self-hosting Screenity
[](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity#self-hosting-screenity)
You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:
  1. Download the latest Build.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/releases)
  2. Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
  3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
  4. That's it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity#enabling-save-to-google-drive) to set up the Google Drive integration.


## Creating a development version
[](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity#creating-a-development-version)
> ❗️ Note that the license has changed to [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) for the current MV3 version (Screenity version 3.0.0 and higher). Make sure to read the license and the [Terms of Service](https://screenity.io/en/terms/) regarding intellectual property.
  1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **14**.
  2. Clone this repository.
  3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
  4. Run `npm start`.
  5. Load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/` , and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
  6. Click on `Load unpacked extension`.
  7. Select the `build` folder.


### Enabling Save to Google Drive
[](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity#enabling-save-to-google-drive)
To enable the Google Drive Upload (authorization consent screen) you must change the client_id in the manifest.json file with your linked extension key.
You can create it accessing [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and selecting Create Credential > OAuth Client ID > Chrome App. To create a persistent extension key, you can follow the steps detailed [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/key).
