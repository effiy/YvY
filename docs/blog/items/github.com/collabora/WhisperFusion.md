[](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperFusion#----seamless-conversations-with-ai-with-ultra-low-latency)
Welcome to WhisperFusion. WhisperFusion builds upon the capabilities of the [WhisperLive](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive) and [WhisperSpeech](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech) by integrating Mistral, a Large Language Model (LLM), on top of the real-time speech-to-text pipeline. Both LLM and Whisper are optimized to run efficiently as TensorRT engines, maximizing performance and real-time processing capabilities. While WhiperSpeech is optimized with torch.compile.
## Features
[](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperFusion#features)
  * **Real-Time Speech-to-Text** : Utilizes OpenAI WhisperLive to convert spoken language into text in real-time.
  * **Large Language Model Integration** : Adds Mistral, a Large Language Model, to enhance the understanding and context of the transcribed text.
  * **TensorRT Optimization** : Both LLM and Whisper are optimized to run as TensorRT engines, ensuring high-performance and low-latency processing.
  * **torch.compile** : WhisperSpeech uses torch.compile to speed up inference which makes PyTorch code run faster by JIT-compiling PyTorch code into optimized kernels.


## Hardware Requirements
[](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperFusion#hardware-requirements)
  * A GPU with at least 24GB of RAM
  * For optimal latency, the GPU should have a similar FP16 (half) TFLOPS as the RTX 4090. Here are the [hardware specifications](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-4090.c3889) for the RTX 4090.


The demo was run on a single RTX 4090 GPU. WhisperFusion uses the Nvidia TensorRT-LLM library for CUDA optimized versions of popular LLM models. TensorRT-LLM supports multiple GPUs, so it should be possible to run WhisperFusion for even better performance on multiple GPUs.
## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperFusion#getting-started)
We provide a Docker Compose setup to streamline the deployment of the pre-built TensorRT-LLM docker container. This setup includes both Whisper and Phi converted to TensorRT engines, and the WhisperSpeech model is pre-downloaded to quickly start interacting with WhisperFusion. Additionally, we include a simple web server for the Web GUI.
  * Build and Run with docker compose


```
mkdir docker/scratch-space
cp docker/scripts/build-* docker/scripts/run-whisperfusion.sh docker/scratch-space/
docker compose build
export MODEL=Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct  #Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct or phi-2, By default WhisperFusion uses phi-2
docker compose up
```

  * Start Web GUI on `http://localhost:8000`
