# OpenGlass - Open Source Smart Glasses
[](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass#openglass---open-source-smart-glasses)
Turn any glasses into hackable smart glasses with less than $25 of off-the-shelf components. Record your life, remember people you meet, identify objects, translate text, and more.

## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass#getting-started)
Follow these steps to set up OpenGlass:
### Hardware
[](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass#hardware)
  1. Gather the required components:
     * [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C69FFVHH/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
     * [EEMB LP502030 3.7v 250mAH battery](https://www.amazon.com/EEMB-Battery-Rechargeable-Lithium-Connector/dp/B08VRZTHDL)
     * [3D printed glasses mount case](https://storage.googleapis.com/scott-misc/openglass_case.stl)
  2. 3D print the glasses mount case using the provided STL file.
  3. Open the [firmware folder](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass/tree/main/firmware) and open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
     * If you don't have the Arduino IDE installed, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
     * Alternatively, follow the steps in the [firmware readme](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/firmware/readme.md) to build using `arduino-cli`
  4. Follow the software preparation steps to set up the Arduino IDE for the XIAO ESP32S3 board:
     * Add ESP32 board package to your Arduino IDE: 
       * Navigate to File > Preferences, and fill "Additional Boards Manager URLs" with the URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
       * Navigate to Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., type the keyword `esp32` in the search box, select the latest version of `esp32`, and install it.
     * Select your board and port: 
       * On top of the Arduino IDE, select the port (likely to be COM3 or higher).
       * Search for `xiao` in the development board on the left and select `XIAO_ESP32S3`.
  5. Before you flash go to the "Tools" drop down in the Arduino IDE and make sure you set "PSRAM:" to be "PSRAM: "OPI PSRAM"


[![Like this](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/raw/main/image.png)](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/image.png)
  1. Upload the firmware to the XIAO ESP32S3 board.


### Software
[](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass#software)
  1. Clone the OpenGlass repository and install the dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass.git
cd openglass
npm install

```

You can also use **yarn** to install, by doing
```
yarn install

```

  2. Add API keys for Groq and OpenAI in the `keys.ts` file located at <https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/sources/keys.ts>.
  3. For Ollama, self-host the REST API from the repository at <https://github.com/ollama/ollama> and add the URL to the `keys.ts` file. The URL should be <http://localhost:11434/api/chat>
  4. go to terminal and type "ollama pull moondream:1.8b-v2-fp16"
  5. Start the application:
```
npm start

```

If using **yarn** start the application with
```
yarn start

```

Note: This is an Expo project. For now, open the localhost link (this will appear after completing step 5) to access the web version.
