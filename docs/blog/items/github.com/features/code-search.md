Code Search
# Exactly what you’re looking for
With GitHub code search, your code—and the world’s—is at your fingertips.
[Try now](https://github.com/search?type=code)[Contact sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fcode-search&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)
![Screenshot of the GitHub code review interface displaying a repository's file structure and code editor. The left panel shows a file explorer with folders such as .github, .reuse, LICENSES, and library, with the wtf8.rs file currently open in the main editor. The code in the editor is written in Rust, defining a CodePoint struct and its related implementation. A search box at the bottom left shows search results for 'CodePoint' within the repository, listing various matches such as class CodePoint and implementation CodePoint. On the right side, a detailed symbol reference panel shows the definition of CodePoint and lists 24 references found in the code. The background features a gradient from green to teal, highlighting the focused and interactive nature of the code review process.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/code-search/fp24/hero.webp)
## Search, navigate, and understand your team’s code—and billions of lines of public code.
### Fast, relevant results
Code search understands your code—and brings you relevant results with incredible speed.
### A power userʼs dream
Search using regular expressions, boolean operations, keyboard shortcuts, and more.
### More than just search
Dig deeper with the all-new code view—tightly integrating browsing and code navigation.
## Way more than grep.
GitHub code search can search across multiple repositories and is always up to date. It understands your code, and puts the most relevant results first.
**Suggestions, completions, and more.** Use the new search input to find symbols and files—and jump right to them.
![Screenshot showing the GitHub code search interface, with a search query for 'CodePoint' within the rust-lang/rust repository. The search results include various symbols and files related to 'CodePoint,' such as 'class CodePoint' in the library/wtf8.rs file, 'implementation CodePoint' in another file, and specific functions and fields like from_u32_unchecked and is_known_utf8. Each result has a 'Jump to' link on the right, allowing users to quickly navigate to the corresponding code. The background features a gradient from teal to green.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/code-search/fp24/features-river-1.webp)
**Powerful search syntax.** Know exactly what you’re looking for? Express it with our powerful search operators.

The background features a teal-to-green gradient.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/code-search/fp24/features-river-2.webp)
## Meet the all-new code view.
Dig deeper into complex codebases with tightly integrated search, code navigation and browsing.
**Code navigation.** Instantly jump to definitions in over 10 languages. No setup required.
![Screenshot of GitHub's code navigation panel showing details for the symbol CodePoint. It highlights the definition of CodePoint as a struct in the code and lists 24 references to it within the same file. The interface is dark-themed with a gradient background transitioning from green to blue.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/code-search/fp24/features-river-3.webp)
**File browser.** Keep all your code in context and instantly switch files with the new file tree pane.
![Screenshot of the file explorer in GitHub's code interface, showing a directory structure. The main branch \(main\) is selected at the top. Folders like .github, .reuse, LICENSES, and library are visible, with the library folder expanded to reveal files such as backtrace.rs, condvar.rs, fs.rs, and wtf8.rs, with wtf8.rs currently selected. The background features a gradient from green to teal.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/code-search/fp24/features-river-4.webp)
