Screenshot of a GitHub Discussions page for the ’octoinvaders’ project, showing categorized discussion threads with tags like ’answered’ and ’Long term.’ The interface features playful elements like a mona emjoi and a rocket icon, highlighting community interaction.
## Dedicated space for conversations
Decrease the burden of managing active work in issues and pull requests by providing a separate space to host ongoing discussions, questions, and ideas.
**Mark what’s most helpful.** Highlight quality responses and make the best answer more discoverable for future community members to find.
![Screenshot of a GitHub Discussion where JohnCreek asks for game power-up ideas, and tonyjaramillo's reply suggesting 'Hubot' as a sidekick is marked as the accepted answer. The background has a pink-to-purple gradient.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/discussions/fp24/features-river-1.webp)
**Thread conversations.** Keep context in-tact and conversations on track with threaded comments.
![Screenshot of a GitHub Discussions thread where enstyled suggests a power-up idea involving Hubot revealing a path and protecting Mona. The post has received 5 upvotes and several reactions. Below, pifafu and tobiasahlin add to the discussion, suggesting Hubot could provide different power-ups depending on levels and appreciating the collaboration idea. The background has a gradient from pink to purple.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/discussions/fp24/features-river-2.webp)
**Ask your community with polls.** Gauge interest in a feature, vote on a meetup time, or learn more about your community with custom polls.
![Screenshot of a GitHub poll created by JohnCreek titled 'Power-up contest.' The poll asks participants to choose their favorite power-up idea for Mona in a game. The poll is part of a discussion in the 'Feedback' category, and the background features a gradient from pink to purple.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/discussions/fp24/features-river-3.webp)
**Leverage GraphQL API and webhooks.** Decrease maintainer burden by integrating your workflows where your teams already are.
![Screenshot of a Slack-like interface named 'OctoSlack' with the #community channel selected. The right panel displays a community feed from GitHub Discussions, where Robotoocat announces a new poll created by johncreek titled 'Power-up contest.' The message includes a snippet of the poll description and a link to the discussion. Robotoocat also notes that ajashams voted in the poll. The interface features a purple-to-pink gradient background.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/discussions/fp24/features-river-4.webp)
**Give your open ended conversations the room they need outside of issues.** Convert discussions into issues when you’re ready to scope out work.
![Screenshot of a closed GitHub issue titled 'Gameplay improvements #1192.' CameronFoxly suggests adding power-ups, and Johncreek proposes taking the discussion to the community. The post has likes and reactions. The background has a pink-to-purple gradient.](https://github.com/images/modules/site/discussions/fp24/features-river-5.webp)
