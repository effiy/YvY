Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0
International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public
License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 -- Definitions.
 a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
   and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
   arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
   permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
   Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
   Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
   Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
   synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
   closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
   performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
   Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
   categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
   specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
   Rights.
 c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
   absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
   fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
   Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
   agreements.
 d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
   any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
   that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
   or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
   License.
 f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
   terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
   all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
   Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
   under this Public License.
 h. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
   commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
   this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
   other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
   file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
   no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
   exchange.
 i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
   process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
   as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
   dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
   available to the public including in ways that members of the
   public may access the material from a place and at a time
   individually chosen by them.
 j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
   resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
   the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
   as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
   equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
   under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 -- Scope.
 a. License grant.
    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
     the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
     non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
     exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
      a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
        in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
      b. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material
        for NonCommercial purposes only.
    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
     Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
     License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
     its terms and conditions.
    3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
     6(a).
    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
     Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
     all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
     and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
     Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
     authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
     necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
     technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
     Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
     simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
     (4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.
      a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
        recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
        receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
        Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
        Public License.
      b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
        any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
        apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
        Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
        Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
        Material.
    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
     may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
     are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
     with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
     the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
     provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 b. Other rights.
    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
     licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
     privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
     the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
     assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
     extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
     Rights, but not otherwise.
    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
     Public License.
    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
     collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
     Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
     under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
     licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
     reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
     the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
     purposes.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.
 a. Attribution.
    1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:
      a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
        with the Licensed Material:
         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
          Material and any others designated to receive
          attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
          the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
          designated);
        ii. a copyright notice;
        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
          warranties;
         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
          extent reasonably practicable;
      b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
        retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
      c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
        Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
        hyperlink to, this Public License.
     For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under
     this Public License to Share Adapted Material.
    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
     reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
     which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
     reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
     hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
     information.
    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
     information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
     reasonably practicable.

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
   to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
   portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
   only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
   contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
   all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
   EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
   AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
   ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
   IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
   KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
   ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
   TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
   COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
   USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
   DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
   IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
   possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
   waiver of all liability.

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
   Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
   this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
   terminate automatically.
 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
   Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
     it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
     violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
   of this Public License.
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
   Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
   distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
   will not terminate this Public License.
 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
   License.

Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
   terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
