RenderCV engine is a Typst-based Python package with a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to version-control your CV/resume as source code. It reads a CV written in a YAML file with Markdown syntax, converts it into a [Typst](https://typst.app) code, and generates a PDF.
RenderCV engine's focus is to provide these three features:
  * **Content-first approach:** Users should be able to focus on the content instead of worrying about the formatting.
  * **A mechanism to version-control a CV's content and design separately:** The content and design of a CV are separate issues and they should be treated separately.
  * **Robustness:** A PDF should be delivered if there aren't any errors. If errors exist, they should be clearly explained along with solutions.


It takes a YAML file that looks like this:
```
cv:
 name: John Doe
 location: Location
 email: john.doe@example.com
 phone: tel:+1-609-999-9995
 social_networks:
  - network: LinkedIn
   username: john.doe
  - network: GitHub
   username: john.doe
 sections:
  welcome_to_RenderCV!:
   - '[RenderCV](https://rendercv.com) is a Typst-based CV
    framework designed for academics and engineers, with Markdown
    syntax support.'
   - Each section title is arbitrary. Each section contains
    a list of entries, and there are 7 different entry types
    to choose from.
  education:
   - institution: Stanford University
    area: Computer Science
    degree: PhD
    location: Stanford, CA, USA
    start_date: 2023-09
    end_date: present
    highlights:
     - Working on the optimization of autonomous vehicles
      in urban environments
  ...
```

Then, it produces one of these PDFs with its corresponding Typst file, Markdown file, HTML file, and images as PNGs. Click on the images below to preview PDF files.

RenderCV comes with a JSON Schema so that the YAML input file can be filled out interactively.

## Getting Started
[](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv#getting-started)
RenderCV engine is very easy to install (`pip install "rendercv[full]"`) and easy to use (`rendercv new "John Doe"`). Follow the [user guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/user_guide) to get started.
## Motivation
[](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv#motivation)
We are developing a [purpose-built app](https://rendercv.com) for writing CVs and resumes that will be available on mobile and web. This Python project is the foundation of that app. Check out [our blog post](https://rendercv.com/introducing-rendercv/) to learn more about why one would use such an app.
## Contributing
[](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv#contributing)
All contributions to RenderCV are welcome! To get started, please read [the developer guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/developer_guide).
